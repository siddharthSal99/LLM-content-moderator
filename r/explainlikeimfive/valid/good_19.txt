Title: Eli5 : Why does water end up in the kidney and not food ? 
Post Text: When you consume food and u drink water i understand that both go into your stomach , but water ends up in the kidneys . What stops food/broken down food  from entering the kidneys as well along with water ? Where in the stomach is the bifurcation taking place ?
