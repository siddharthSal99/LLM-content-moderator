Title: Eli5 what are the barriers to getting the world using the same electrical outlet 
Post Text: I get the usual reasons for global adoption, mostly the 'that just isn't the way it's done' and adapting all other markets to follow suit. 

But are there such differences in electrical generation that would stop the rest of the world moving over to the British 3-pin plug (which is obviously the best and not just because it's the one I'm used to...)?
