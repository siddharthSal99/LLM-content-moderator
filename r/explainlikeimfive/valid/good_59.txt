Title: Eli5 What does buffing or polishing do to the surface of metal ? 
Post Text: 
What is a scratch on a microscopic level , why it looks different and dull . Like when we buff or polish the surface what is happening . Are we pressing down the peaks or the metal is being removed till it reaches the level of scratch 
Is buffing like sanding only ? Are we removing the metal ? 
Can someone explain the science of polishing / smooth surface and scratches on metal
