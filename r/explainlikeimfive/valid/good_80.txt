Title: ELI5: How do hormones in the female body differ before and after the fertile stage? Why do medical specialists rarely refer to the early stages when dealing with various health issues? 
Post Text: Basically, I'm trying to grasp why medical specialists only look at inducing a (post)menopause-like state when it comes to treating various ailments. Think of problems with fertility, but also diseases like PMS, endometriosis and PCOS. 

Is there a reason they don't (yet?) emulate the earlier stages of the female body's hormonal layout? 

Cheers!
