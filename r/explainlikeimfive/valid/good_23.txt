Title: ELI5: How do LightYears work? 
Post Text: If the light takes a year to travel, and we are seeing something millions of light years away, and that means it’s that many years old, how tf are we seeing it? 
( sorry if the flair is wrong, I stared at Physics and Planetary Science for a while trying to figure out which to use)

Edit: You guys are like , super NOT ok right? 😂Just carrying the knowledge and understanding that the sun may be out and we dont know yet and that no one’s ever actually seen their own face in the “present moment” means you’re all beyond zooted all the time right?
