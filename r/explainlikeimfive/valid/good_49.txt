Title: Eli5: why aren’t there Panda hybrids? 
Post Text: Like the title says. There are known grizzly and polar bear hybrids (Grolars?) even the odd Lion + Tiger combos. Has there ever been a Panda bear mixed with anything else? I know they have issues breeding within their own community but has anyone ever “scienced” a new creation?
