Title: ELI5: What is the difference between Amphetamine Sulfate and Dextroamphetamine-Amphetamine? 
Post Text: My psychiatrist prescribed Adderall 10mg, as normal with my Atomoxetine 80mg. Historically, this has been substituted to the generic Dextroamphetamine-Amphetamine 10mg or "Mixed Amphetamine Salts" without any issue. However, today CVS decided to substitute it into Amphetamine Sulfate 10mg, which was then denied by ExpressScripts saying it needed Prior Authorization.

I checked my plan's formulary, and sure enough Amphetamine Sulfate has "PA" next to it, but not Dextroamphetamine-Amphetamine. However, the Pharmacy Tech acted like there were a lot of different names for Adderall and Amphetamine Sulfate was one of them, but then was surprised when Dextroamphetamine-Amphetamine was approved (although they were out of it).

What is the difference between these two drugs? Are they both acceptable generics for Adderall? My understanding from Google is that Amphetamine Sulfate is the generic for a drug called Evekeo, and that it has a different formulation. Was it correct for them to make the substitution?
