Title: [ELI5] How is the glycemic index calculated? 
Post Text: Is all food calculated by the same amount of grams and then the GI number is calculated? I basically don’t get how much of each food item equals the GI number

Also say your watching your GI cause of high blood sugar, if you eat 2x the GI amount does the GI number double or will the GI always stay the same no matter how much of the food you eat and as long as it’s under the low glycemic index you should be fine? 

Sorry I’m so confused lol!
