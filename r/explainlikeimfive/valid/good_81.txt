Title: Eli5 - Warm &amp; cold blooded 
Post Text: Hi there,

Please could someone explain why some animals are cold blooded, as it just seems like a disadvantage straight off the bat? 

Also not sure on the difference as to why or how some animals are warm blooded?

I hope these questions make sense to some of you smart people out there.
