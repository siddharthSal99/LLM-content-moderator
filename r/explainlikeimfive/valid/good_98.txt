Title: eli5 How do we know that MBR is 13.8B light years away? 
Post Text: So i get how you can calculate the distance of an object like a galaxy by its movement or the light we get from it but if mbr is everywhere you point your telescope at how do we calculate its distance/age? How do we get that very precise number?
