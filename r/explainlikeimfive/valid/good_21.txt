Title: ELI5: What was 'wrong' with the borders of Syria, Iraq, and Jordan following Sykes-Picot in 1932 (or there abouts)? Did they follow the former Ottoman Empire internal divisons at all? Did they remove self governence / areas of control for different ethnic groups? 
Post Text: Just looking at the map the borders of Syria, Iraq, and Jordan seem very arbitary.  Was there an area called 'Syria' during the Ottoman empire?  Or Iraq? Did Sunni's rule Shia's and visa versa before that?   

The Ottoman Empire was huge and relatively stable before the post WW1 division, so how did the European's mess it up so spectacularly?    
Many thanks
