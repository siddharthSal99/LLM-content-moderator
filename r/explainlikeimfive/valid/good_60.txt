Title: Eli5 What exactly is a radical?? 
Post Text: My teacher told me a radical is a group of atoms binded together to make an atomic group such as OH or NO3, but i did some digging and found out a radical is sort of a free electron(from what i understood at least) so which is right?? And my teacher isn't that knowledgeable so shes probably wrong and thats why i came here to make sure.
