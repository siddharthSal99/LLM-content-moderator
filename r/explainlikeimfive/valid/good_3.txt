Title: ELI5 why cotton mouth can damage your teeth 
Post Text: I went to the dentist yesterday and we discussed my cannabis usage. He then explained that the dry "cotton mouth" one gets from smoking is terrible for your teeth as you lose the natural protective coating of saliva.

Can someone explain how this works, please?
