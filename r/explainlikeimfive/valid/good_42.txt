Title: ELI5: When physicists describe gravity as a well. As a physical depression in spacetime. Is that literally the case or is that just to help us understand it better? 
Post Text: I've seen the images of spacetime described as a physical medium. And how objects with a lot of mass create a "well" in spacetime that causes the effects of gravity. I'm sure we've all seen the videos of a bed sheet with heavy balls placed on it. 

Is that whole way of imagining gravity just a nice way to illustrate it to make it easier to understand? Or is that what physicists thing is really happening? That heavy things literally alter the shape of some cosmic medium that we all live in, and that steep well it creates is what creates the effects of gravity?
