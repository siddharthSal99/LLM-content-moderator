Title: ELI5 financing a car 
Post Text: So I get the gist that you can finance through a dealership or your bank, but if you don't know the total you're paying for the car until you're there and it's negotiated, how do you know how much to try getting for a loan from your bank? 

Do people usually go to a dealership, negotiate a price and then contact their bank and go back once they secure the loan? Do you get pre approved for the amount you think you'll need before going to the dealership? I just don't get the process.
