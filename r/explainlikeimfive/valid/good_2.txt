Title: ELI5: Why do we feel hungry, weak, or lightheaded at all, when the body can just burn the stored fat? 
Post Text: When we need energy, can't the body just burn the stored fat? Isn't that the whole point of stored fat? Why will we feel hungry, weak, lightheaded, etc. at all? I understand if the body doesn't have enough fat (if you're super skinny), it would make sense to feel hungry, but I don't understand why would that be the case if there's enough fat to go around.
