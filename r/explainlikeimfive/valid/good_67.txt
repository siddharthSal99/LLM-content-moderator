Title: Eli5: I need someone to explain what happens to electrons when they travel from one object to another? Specific question inside. 
Post Text: I was watching a video on electricity, that explained when we rub our feet on the carpet (an insulator) electrons from our body are being taken by the carpet and we build a positive charge. Then if we touch a metal object, electrons from that object, like say a door handle will transfer electrons to create an equilibrium and give us an electrick shock. My question is how does the door handle now reproduce those electrons it lost? Or am i thinking about this all wrong? Thankyou
