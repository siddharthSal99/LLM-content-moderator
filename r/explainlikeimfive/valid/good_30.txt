Title: ELI5 how the outer ear (the pinna) is supposed to collect sound waves and direct them to the ear canal. That is what nearly every online resource says happens and I'm wondering if it is a myth or true. 
Post Text: Resources, even medical ones, can perpetuate things that "sound right" but aren't rooted in evidence-based science. I wonder if the whole outer ear thing is just a myth. I haven't found anything online to support how sound waves are collected and directed towards the ear canal.
