Title: [ELI5] How does stamina work ? 
Post Text: So as I understand about lifting weight is that, when we lift, we cause minor injure on our muscle tissue, and then the body will use the nutrions in the body to fix and improve tho muscle, make them bigger and stronger.

But in term of cardio or running, we using "stamina" instead, but what exactly is "stamina" ? What is broken when we run and what is fixed and rebuilt after everyrun we made to increase this "stamina" so we can run longer ?

I dont see we getting jacked if we're only running, we do loosing weight and become skinnier, which is reasonable since we would use a lot of energy for a long run, but again, what physically changed in our body that even we couldn't observe it with our eyes, it still helps us run longer?
