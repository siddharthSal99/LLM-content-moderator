Title: Eli5: apparently nulliparity increases risk for reproductive cancers . How is carrying one baby for 9 months reduces the risk? 
Post Text: Let’s say a woman has periods for 3 decades , periods and hormonal ups and downs only stop for 9 months for the baby and it reduces the chance of cancer? 

 Isn’t it a very short period of time to be effective to reduce the chance of cancers?
