Title: Eli5: How do two massive space objects with two separate space wells, so deep, attract each other? 
Post Text: Massive objects form space wells so deep enough to pull other space objects. But, massive objects attract each other. If the space wells are so deep because of their masses, how can they attract each other? Won't there be a wall like obstacle created between two separate space-wells?
