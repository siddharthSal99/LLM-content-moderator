Title: ELI5: How does undervaluing a nation's currency work? 
Post Text: In the book Good Economics the author says, "Most banks in China are owned by the state. The government at both the local and the national level has played a central role in deciding how land and credit should be allocated. It also decides who gets to move where and with them the supply of labor to various industries. The exchange rate was kept undervalued for some twenty-five years, at the cost of lending billions of dollars to the United States at almost zero interest rates."

I do not understand the part regarding the undervaluing of their own exchange rate by the Chinese government. How does it benefit them? How does it even work? Why do they need to lend money to the United States for that? Can any country do this? Is considered fair-play?
