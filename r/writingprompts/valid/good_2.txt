##This Week’s Challenge

&amp;nbsp;

Welcome to another 5th Sunday here at SEUS! This month I’m doing something a bit different and instead of reaching out to community members, I approached some semi-random folk in the real world to try and shake things up. I think there were some interesting choices, but others are real softballs this time around. I hope you enjoy!
