Title: [PI] "The Hivemind is now recruiting members on a 1 year contract basis. Great benefits, and you dont even have to remain conscious for the duration! Just listen to these happy participants!"

Today is the yearly work seminar. We go over profit margins and the yearly bonus, usually. Of course, the collective will usually begin with a speech. They do love the sound of their... Of the voices they stole.

"Good day to you all, my fellow neighbors, friends, and colleagues. Today, we have found ourselves on the verge of greatness! Our efforts have brought up profits by 237.5%!" This brings cheers, and I do too. Who wouldn't cheer for a 10k bonus? 

"However, we believe that we can do better." There it is. "Yes, we, the collective, have made an error." Now, I am listening. The all-knowing collective made an error? Impossible! They haven't made an error since they started knocking on my door every week for the past 12 years, for six hours at a time. Them? A mistake? Never. 

"We have realized that many people are worried about joining the collective and losing that which made them, them. Worried that they will lose that which they love in the name of efficiency." Suddenly, I like where this is going. "We have decided to make a change. To add to our ways of recruitment and cater to those with these fears." I'm not so sure I like it anymore, but I am still intrigued. "The collective is now recruiting members on a 1 year contract basis."

This has made me far more interested. They continue talking about the benefits. They bring people to the front, talking about the program. One year. You can either enjoy the benefits off living in the collective or they will keep you asleep for the year. At the end, they rejuvenate you one or two years, depending on what you check in the fourm, and release you. You keep the money you earn and a little extra on top. 

"Thank you for listening to our part of the meeting. We will now get back to the regularly scheduled program." The rest of the meeting went as it did every year. Management that wasn't part of the collective hemmed and hawed at the bonus we would receive but were out voted by the collective. 

I'm not really listening to it anymore. The fourm is knocking at my door. The rhythmic knocking taking me away from the world. The meeting ends, but the knocking does not. I go home and push it out of my mind. 

Over the next few weeks, they backed off. They don't knock for hours on end. Five minutes at most. My brother sounds more like himself. I missed his normal tone of speaking more than I care to admit. The fourm never leaves my mind like I want it to. 

The money, the benefits, all of it. I have no real friends or family, well, aside from my brother. To give them a year would save money and make more as well. My brother and all members of the hive only talk analytics. "We can't try and force your hand. It will only push you away." Well, my brother slips in how nice it is, but only if it isn't related to the contract. 

I look at my face, my eyes. I look exhausted. I am burning out. The collective is young. Perhaps it is trying to change its ways. Maybe I should give it a chance. 

I look down at the fourm, the contact. They will keep my house in my name, and unless I write it in, they will not access it in any way, aside from turning off the bills and paying taxes. They will keep me fed and clothed for free. If I give permission, they will even work on my health.

The fourm knocks on my door. Polite, asking to be let in. 

I open the door.
