Title: Mickey and Minnie Mouse getting a divorce 
Post Text: Mickey and Minnie are getting a divorce. They are in court before a judge.

Minnie's attorney addresses the judge.

"Your honor. Mickey alleges Minnie is crazy. I have an evaluation of her mental condition from a highly competent psychiatrist. The report concludes quite simply. Minnie is not crazy. I would like to submit it into evidence."

The judge addresses Mickey. "Well, Mickey what do have to say to this evaluation?"

Mickey responds on advice of counsel.

"Respectfully your honor I ask you to excuse my language in my response to this ridiculous assertion by opposing counsel. I never said Minnie was crazy. I did say she was fucking Goofy!"
