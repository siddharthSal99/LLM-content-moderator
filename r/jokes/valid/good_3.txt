Title: Two Southern belles are walking down a country road. 
Post Text: They are out enjoying a sunset walk and admiring the scenery, when they come across a man taking photographs.  The man, being awestruck at the beauty of the two ladies, asks if he can take their picture with the setting sun in the background.

The ladies discuss the idea and eventually agree.  

The photographer begins setting up his tripod and adjusting his camera.

One of the ladies asks, "What is he doing?"

The other replies, in a thick Southern drawl, "He's going to focus."

Then the first says, "Both of us?"
