Title: Bike 
Post Text: There was a man whose name was David, his pride and joy was his beautiful and powerful bike. He loved it more than anything in the world. One day, he was cruising on his bike when he had a minor heart attack, and he rolled off the road and into a tree. Luckily, he had just suffered some minor injuries, but the bike was severely damaged...

One fine man was traveling along the same road, and he saw this. He helped David and loaded his bike on his truck and took him to a hospital. Later they got talking and he said that he too love bikes and he can fix the bike for him...

David was beyond happy to hear it since he thought that his beautiful bike was gone forever... a few days later, the kind man brought his now good as a new bike back, and David was so overwhelmed that he declared that the young man was now like his son... they spent a great deal of time together enjoying their shared love of bikes... 

A few months later, David had another heart attack and died, and when his will was read, it was discovered that he left his bike to not his own son but to the young man... the son was understandably upset, and his mother argued against giving the young man the very costly bike. The lawyer said that he could not do anything because it's in the will, and David left his bike to a man he considered as a son...

The wife was very annoyed and said: "But that's Hardly David's son..."
