Title: A joke about an old Jew. 
Post Text: For context, the Western Wall, found on the Temple Mount is the holiest site in Judaism.  
  
Here is the joke: 

An old Jew prays briefly at the Western Wall every morning.   
  
A reporter says to the old Jew:  
  
"What have you been praying for?"  
  
The old Jew says: "I have been praying for peace at this wall ever since I was bar mitzvahed at age 13.   
For decades, I have prayed for peace here at this holy shrine, every morning. And then, I go about my day. I have been working with activist groups for years to try to achieve peace."  
  
The reporter asks: "And what has it  been like to pray for peace here every day?"  
  
And the old Jew sighs and says:   


"It's been like talking to a wall."
