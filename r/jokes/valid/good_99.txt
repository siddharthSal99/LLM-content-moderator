Title: The priest angrily asks the altar boy standing two meters away, 
Post Text: "Are you secretly drinking the holy wine?"

The altar boy remains silent. The priest's anger grows.  
"I'm asking you! Can't you hear me?"

"No, I can't hear anything from here, Father."

"What do you mean? You're just two steps away and you can't hear me?"

The altar boy smirks,  
"Why don't we switch places and you'll see..."

They swap places. Now the altar boy asks,  
"Who's embezzling the church donations?"

The priest mutters,  
"You know what? You're right! You really can't hear anything from here."
