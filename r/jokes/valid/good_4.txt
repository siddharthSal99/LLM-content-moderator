Title: Many years ago I went to my High School prom 
Post Text: It was a very involved process.

Leading up to the prom I had to stand in line to get fitted for my tuxedo.

I had to stand in line to reserve the limo for my date.

Then I had to stand in line again to pick my tux up once it was ready.

The day of the prom finally arrived, but I had to go stand in line to pick up my boutonni√®re.

That florist was out of corsages, so I had to go stand in line at yet another florist to get a corsage for myself.

Finally, the limo picks me up and takes me to her house.  I meet the dad, give her the corsage, and escort her to the limo in style.

The limo drops us off at the prom, and we dance a few dances.  Then my date says she is thirsty, so I go to get her a drink.

And, much to my surprise, there was no punch line.
