Title: A priest stands in front of his congregation holding 3 envelopes 
Post Text: He says "I hold in my hands three sermons: a £1,000 sermon that lasts 15 minutes, a £500 sermon that lasts 30 minutes, and a £100 sermon that lasts a full hour.

"Now we'll take the collection and see which one I'll deliver"
