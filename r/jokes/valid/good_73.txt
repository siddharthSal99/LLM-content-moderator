Title: My Palestinian Cousin's favorite Arabic joke 
Post Text: Two criminals are given the death sentence. Before theyre executed, the warden asks the first man "What is your last request?". The man says "Please, sir, could I see my mother one last time before I go?". The warden turns to an officer and asks him to fetch the man's mother. In the meantime, he asks the second man "And you? Any last requests?".

The man thinks for a moment, looks at the first guy, and finally answers "Nah, just don't let that guy see his mom"
