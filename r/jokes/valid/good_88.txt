Title: A English man, an Irish man and an American are stranded on an island, until they find a genie. 
Post Text: The genie explains to them that usually he'd give them 3 wishes, but because there's three people and they all found him equally, that everyone gets one wish.

First, the English man makes his wish.

"Well, I've been stranded on this island for 2 years now, so I wish to go back home to my family in England."

The genie grants his wish, and the English man disappears with a poof.

Now, it's time for the American to make his wish.

"Well, I've been stranded on this island for two years as well, so I wish to go back home to my family in America."

And the genie grants his wish, and the American disappears with a poof.

Next, the Irish man makes his wish.

"Well, I'm real lonely on this island, so I wish my two buddies were back here with me!"
