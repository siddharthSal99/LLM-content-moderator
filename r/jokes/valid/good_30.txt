Title: At a public beach, a man decides to take a swim 
Post Text: As the water reaches his waist, he suddenly feels a hand grab him by the balls. A voice asks, "Plus two or minus two?" 
Startled, the man quickly replies, “Plus two!” The hand releases him. He rushes to the shore and checks his pants to find he now has four balls.

Determined to fix the situation, he re-enters the water. Once again, the mysterious hand grabs his now four balls and the voice asks, "Plus four or minus four?"
