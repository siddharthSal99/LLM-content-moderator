Title: A man goes to the hospital 
Post Text: 
The doctors are pretty used to seeing him by now as he's notorious for swallowing things he shouldn't be. (the last time he was in there he'd swallowed a battery. That shocked the surgeon removing it)

So the doctor see him. "Good evening. What's the trouble today?"
The man replies, "I've swallowed something"
The doctor looks at him, already slightly annoyed about the whole thing,  and asks "Will you tell me what it is?" 
To which the man just says "no" 
So the doctor orders an x-ray. A short while later he gets the pictures back and sure enough, sitting there in the man's intestine is a key.

The doctor looks at the x-ray, thinks for a moment, then tells the man, "well, it seems you've swallowed a key. It's not perticularly large and, luckily for all of us, the point is away from the direction of travel so you should pass it naturally in the next 6 hours. I recommend you go home and wait for that to happen."

The man looks back "I can't do that Doctor, I'm locked out"
