Title: A woman's husband dies, and she spends many years as a widow, missing him terribly. 
Post Text: In time, she too passes away, and is excited to see her husband in heaven.

She runs up to him, ready to give him a big hug, saying, "I've missed you so much!"

The husband says, "Hey, hey, hey, not so fast. The deal was 'til death do we part.'"
