Title: A friend recently gave me a What Would Jesus Do bracelet, and it really made a difference in my outlook. 
Post Text: It was going great, until I got in a bit of an argument with some guy in a Starbucks line. It getting a bit heated, and I looked at my bracelet.... so I said unto him, "Be fruitful, and multiply."


But not in those words.
