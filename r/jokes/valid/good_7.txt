Title: The new Vietnamese restaurant was getting great reviews, so I decided to try it 
Post Text: Clearly the word had spread, as when I got there, hundreds of people were already waiting to get in. The line went all the way around the block. Some people got there hours before the place even opened. I thought about just going somewhere else, but I figured if it was that popular, the food must be really good. I took my place in line and waited. I waited and waited for what seemed like an eternity. After several hours, I was finally at the front of the line. They sat me at a nice table by the window, and I ordered a bowl of soup. I was extremely hungry at this point, but luckily the service was quick. They brought me my food, I took my obligatory Instagram pictures, and got ready to eat. I took the first bite, and it was terrible. One of the worst things I have ever tasted. It was a big pho queue.
