Title: A father takes his son to the casino. 
Post Text: A father takes his son to the casino and they lose $1,000 in one hour.
Dad tells his disappointed son “don’t worry son we’ll come back tomorrow and do better”
The next day they come back to the casino and the dad grabs $1,000 and throws it in the garbage and heads for the exit.
The son asks his dad wtf he’s doing and the dad says “yesterday we lost time and money, today we only lost money”
