Title: A man is about to walk into a bar, when a num holding a sign that reads "alcohol is evil" stops him. 
Post Text: The nun tells him about the evils of alcohol, "alcohol is evil! Alcohol is the devils tool!

Then, the nun says something that really effected the man. "What would your parents think!" The man explains how both his parents have passed away, and how he's not sure what they would think.

The nun keeps going on about the evils of drinking. "Your parents are cursing your name from hell!" The man is fed up with this nun, so he asks her: "well how do you know how bad alcohol is? Have you even ever had a drink before?"

"Well, I guess I have never tried it." The nun admits, so the man offers her a deal, he'll buy her a drink, and if she doesn't like it he'll never drink again.

The nun agrees to the deal and enters the bar with the man. The man asks her what she would like to drink, so she asks him what ladies usually drink. The man answers gin.

So he buys her a drink, and she admits she likes it. And tells the man she's leaving to repent for her sins. The man explains to the bartender about how weird that encounter with the nun was.

"That fucking nun at it again?" The barkeep replies.
