How rude are you Americans are.” The army and walks off and tries to find another seat after a couple minutes of searching he walks back up to the lady and says “please, ma’am, may I have your seat. I am very tired.” The woman says “how inconsiderate of you to ask me again” the man then calmly walks up and throws the dog out of the train window and sits down the woman starts screaming and demanding that the man be punished, her husband walks up and says “you Americans are doing everything wrong you drive on the wrong side of the road you use the wrong utensils to eat, and now you’ve thrown the wrong bit** out of the window.”
