sending openai request.
waiting on response...
ChatGPT: Certainly! Here are some examples of bad-faith questions and leading questions:

1. Bad-faith question: "Why are all [insert group] so dumb?" This question is asking for a negative generalization about a particular group and is meant to promote hate or discrimination.

2. Leading question: "Don't you agree that [insert opinion] is the best?" This question is designed to steer the conversation towards a specific answer and discourage alternative viewpoints.

3. Bad-faith question: "Isn't it obvious that [insert political figure] is corrupt and evil?" This question assumes a negative characteristic about a person or group without providing any evidence or room for discussion.

4. Leading question: "Don't you think [insert product] is a waste of money?" This question implies a negative opinion and tries to influence others to agree without considering different perspectives.

5. Bad-faith question: "Why do all [insert religious group] believe in nonsense?" This question is making a sweeping generalization about a religious group and is disrespectful towards their beliefs.

Remember, good-faith questions are those asked with genuine curiosity and a willingness to seek understanding, while bad-faith questions and leading questions are designed to manipulate or provoke specific responses.

ChatGPT: Based on the rules listed, this post potentially violates Rule 2. While it does express a strong opinion, it does so in a disrespectful way by calling a specific group of people "stupid" and "ignorant." Rule 8 may also apply as the post appears to be leading and promoting an agenda. Nonetheless, it would ultimately be up to the moderators to make a final determination based on the context and intent of the post.
