Title: What is the difference between a fault creating an earthquake, and a fault rupturing? 
Post Text: So (I think) I know how a fault creates an earthquake, the stress builds up until itâ€™s released in an instant, causing a movement on the fault and an earthquake. But what exactly does it mean when a fault ruptures? And bonus question; what is a seismic cycle and how does it work? 
Any and all responses are appreciated &lt;3
