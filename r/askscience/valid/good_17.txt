Title: How massive would a mountain located at the geographical center of the USA need to be, to be visible from everywhere in the USA? 
Post Text: Not sure if this is the right place for this.

  
For context, it's for a book I'm writing with a post-apocolyptic high fantasy setting, the USA is just a metric I'm using for general sizing. If it's even possible. I know nothing about earth curvature or any of the equations that would probably be used to calculate this. After a quick google search, geographical center is Lebanon, Kansas (???).
