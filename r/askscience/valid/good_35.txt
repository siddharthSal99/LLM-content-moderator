Title: Did Natural Nuclear Reactors Influence Life's Evolution Through Radiation-Induced Mutations? 
Post Text: I recently read about a natural occuring nuclear fission reactor:   
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural\_nuclear\_fission\_reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor)

Which happens to be in the same location (Gabon, Africa) where (supposedly) the oldest known multicellular organisms have been found:

Also the timing roughtly matches up (1.7billion years - 2 billion years ago)

While this is probably a coincidence, I'm still curious,  is there any research on the impact of radiation on the evolution of early life?
