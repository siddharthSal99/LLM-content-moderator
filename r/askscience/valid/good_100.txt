Title: Can periodically increasing water depth let seaweed grow in deep water ? 
Post Text: Some seaweed species can't grow in deep water because the light penetration is low as you go deep into sea, so by increasing the depth of seaweed as it grows, will the seaweed be able to survive and continue to grow ? 

If not then what would be right approach to produce seaweed that can grow in deep water ?
