Title: AskScience AMA Series: I'm Devika Bhushan, pediatrician, public health leader, and writer driving health innovation, equity, and resilience. I'm deeply committed to destigmatizing living with mental illness and promoting healing. AMA about early adversity and stress, mental health, and resilience! 
Post Text: As the former Acting Surgeon General of California and the Office's inaugural Chief Health Officer, I was a key public health spokesperson and advisor to the California Governor, and I led statewide policy and practice innovation to reimagine how we address trauma, stress and health.

While serving in this role, I publicly shared my own journey with bipolar disorder to help dispel stigma and internalized shame, and to spread hope and light - pursuits I continue to prioritize.

I previously served on Stanford's faculty as a pediatrician and conducted gender, mental health, and health equity research. My areas of expertise are: trauma-informed systems, stress and resilience, gender and health equity, and child health. Now, I advise entities that aim to advance resilience or equity. This includes serving on the national Board of Directors for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).

I spent my early years between the Philippines, India and the US; I'm an immigrant and a first-generation American. I'm also raising a sweetheart of a toddler with my partner of 17 years, while living nomadically - a fun and action-packed journey.

Today, I'm partnering with Number Story to raise awareness around how early adversity and stress can impact our health and well-being - and more importantly, to share tools and strategies for preventing and reversing these impacts.

**I'll be starting at 12:30pm PT (3:30 PM ET, 1930 UT) - so AMA!**
