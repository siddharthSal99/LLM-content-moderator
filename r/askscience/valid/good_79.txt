Title: What sort of events would lead to fossilisation of large land-dwelling dinosaurs? 
Post Text: I understand that fossilisation requires burial under anerobic conditions, but a large Sauropod drowning in a flood, then being buried under enough sediment to preserve it seems almost impossible. Even if it's already dead before the flood, and just the skeleton gets buried shouldn't most bones of this type therefore exhibit marks of predation? Are landslides a possibility for fossilisation environments, or is the soil not anerobic enough?
