Title: Would evolution replicate the same results twice in the same conditions? 
Post Text: Let’s say, for example, time reversed back to when primates diverged from other mammals (85 million years ago).  Would primates still evolve the way they did?  

If random genetic variation is generally the driver of natural selection, wouldn’t there be the possibility that a genetic variation never happens?
