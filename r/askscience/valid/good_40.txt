Title: Could we tell if some oceanic exoplanets could have life from space? 
Post Text: If I'm not wrong, from what I heard and searched, we find exoplanets with advanced telescopes and other tools. Some of those planets are speculated to have ocean-like liquids. Now that's just a scientist's guess when they gather info about the exoplanet, but like with Coral reefs being visible from space, can the same be possible from, let's say footages of these planets? Like, zooming on the footage and observing the oceans from there?

However, I'm aware that if those planets had something similar like Coral reefs here, we could identify alien life already. To simplify the question, if we find an alien planet with oceans, would it be likely that we could find some visible life activity from space footage, similar to coral reefs on Earth? Or it isn't a good analogy?
