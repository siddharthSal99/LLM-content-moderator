Title: Our Sun Appears Yellow, but is actually White, so what happens when it actually does turn Yellow/Orange later in life? 
Post Text: As the title says, as I understand it the white star we see as yellow will eventually shift to a more Yellow/Orange star before turing into a red giant. But during it's Yellow/Orange phase, what will we see? Will it still remain the same hue since we see it as yellow anyway?
