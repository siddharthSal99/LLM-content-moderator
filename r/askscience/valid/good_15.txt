Title: Is it possible to take antivenom before a snake bite? 
Post Text: Would it act the same as if you were to take it directly afterwards? I know that anti venoms can stay in the body for a decent amount of time - but search engines don't seem to be giving a straight answer to this. Yes or no. They all just say why and how antivenom works but I already know why and how I want to know if you can take it BEFORE and when the drawbacks and/or benifits of doing so would be. It's almost like noone's asked before. Either that or my "google-fu" is genuinely that terrible.
