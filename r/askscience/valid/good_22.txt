Title: In 9 hours tropical storm “Otis” transformed into a full category 5 hurricane, the strongest there is. How and why did that happen so fast? 
Post Text: Tropical storms are usually just heavy rains and winds, usually they get strength in open sea specially in hot water. This can take many days.

But Otis just hit Mexico and in just 9 ours it transformed from a weak tropical storm to the strongest type of hurricane there could be. We are almost in November now and the seas are much colder. How did that happen and why was it so fast?
