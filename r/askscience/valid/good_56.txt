Title: what consistency is the cytoskeleton? 
Post Text: when I see videos trying to explain cells, the cytoskeleton always looks so thin and gently waves around like string. I don't see how something like this would be able to provide any structural support to the cell. Is the cell held in shape by the cytoplasm being enough to fill it up like a water balloon, with the cytoskeleton only being there to guide things into a specific shape but not really provide any of the strength on its own the way a regular skeleton does?
