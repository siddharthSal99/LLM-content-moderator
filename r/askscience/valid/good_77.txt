Title: How common is it for a moon to be tidally locked with its planet? 
Post Text: It seems like the craziest coincidence ever.  If it is common, can anyone explain or give an example in layman's terms to help dummies like me understand the physics?  If it is not common, I will probably be convinced that the moon is hiding something from us.  So if that's the case, please attempt to dissuade me, if possible.  Thank you.
