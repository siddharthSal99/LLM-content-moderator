Title: Immunoglobulines with Vaccine are not incompatible ? 
Post Text: First, Sorry for my bad english as french is my first language.


Recently i have been bitten by a stray dog, and after going to the hospital they gave me both the vaccine and the antibodies by injection at the same time.


The emergencies were very busy so i didn't have time to ask the physician about it.


But i don't understand, isn't it useless to give me the vaccine at the same time as the antibodies ?, the antibodies will just attack the vaccine and make it useless.



We learned at school that we have to wait after the birth of a baby to give him vaccines because the maternal antibodies will attack the vaccine and make it useless.



So why the same logic isn't apply here ? i don't understand, can someone explain to me please.
