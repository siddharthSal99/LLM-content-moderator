Title: Is it possible to train a chimp or bonobo to become like us? 
Post Text: When I say "become like us", I don't mean dressing them up in clothes and treating them like a human child. 

What I mean is teaching them to walk on two legs, to speak, to craft tools and all that stuff. And I'm not saying to teach a single chimp or bonobo all this, but to do it gradually over generations, kinda like how we domesticated animals over generations. 

I would also like to know if any of this can be taught to a single chimp or bonobo, too.
