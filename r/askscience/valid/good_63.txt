Title: AskScience AMA Series: I'm a Researcher Using AI to Predict Brain Injury Recovery - Ask Me Anything! 
Post Text: Hello, I'm Adrian Owen, a neuroscientist and researcher from Western University in London, Ontario, and my team has been working on a groundbreaking project using artificial intelligence to predict brain injury recovery.

Our recent research study has been featured ‚Å†[Journal of Neurology](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00415-023-11941-6), and I'm here to answer all your questions about this exciting development. We've made significant strides in understanding and forecasting recovery outcomes for brain injury patients, predicting patients who would recover with an accuracy of 80 per cent. Whether you're curious about the technology, its potential impact or the research process, ask away!
