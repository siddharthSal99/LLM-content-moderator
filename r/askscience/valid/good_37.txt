Title: Is it possible to see the moons of Jupiter with the naked eye? 
Post Text: I've recently grown fascinated with the Galilean Moons, the four big moons orbiting Jupiter. While scrolling their Wikipedia pages I found a part of it that said that they may have been discovered almost 2000 years earlier than previously thought, seeming to suggest that a Chinese astronomer by the name of Gan De had seen "a small reddish star appended to its side", and had directly observed one of  them. None of the moons are red so this probably wasn't one of them in my opinion, but it did get me thinking as to whether or not this would even be possible. It's not ludicrous - the brightest of them, Ganymede, has an apparent magnitude of 4.6, bright enough to be visible to the naked eye, but it is also possible that they would be obscured by the glare of their parent planet. So would it be possible to view the moons of Jupiter with just your naked eye?
