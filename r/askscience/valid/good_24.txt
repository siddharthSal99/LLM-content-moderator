Title: Is there a pattern to the rotation of galaxies? 
Post Text: When we look at 'flat' galaxies, I believe that we can tell their orientation relative to us. Some face us directly, some are edge on.

Is there any pattern to this that we can detect? For example, are the galaxies in certain galactic clusters oriented in a similar way? Or is orientation just random?

If it's not random, does that tell us anything about the initial conditions of the universe (angular momentum, for example)?
