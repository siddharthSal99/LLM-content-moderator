Title: When did Sri Lanka separate from India? 
Post Text: Wikipedia says Sri Lanka was geographically
separated from India in 1480 after a cyclone
destroyed Adam's Bridge. Many online resources
(including esa and Wikipedia) point to
"Rameshwaram Temple Records" that says
Adams Bridge was submerged in the said fashion.
In Sri Lankan historical sources, as far as I know,
all the contact between Sri Lanka and Indian
states are mentioned as happened by naval
means. Sri Lanka was always considered an island
and there is evidence to suggest that they were
connected by a land bridge in pre historic times.
Are there any historical records to support the
claims of Sri Lanka being connected to India as
late as 15th century? If so, how did that affect the
people on the two ends.
