Title: What is the actual deepest river in the US, also what is the actual deepest river in the world? Do we truly know? 
Post Text: I was on a Wikipedia reading about Socotra Island, and after clicking more hyperlinks than I can remember, somehow ended up on the page for the Congo River. It is claimed the Congo is the deepest river in the world, at 720 feet. Out of curiosity o googled the depths of various other rivers, the Amazon, Mississippi, Missouri, and Columbia Rivers. Once I googled the Columbia River, the top featured snippet was from Wikipedia, which claimed “Water depths have been estimated at 1,000 ft at Wallula Gap and 400 ft over modern Portland, Oregon.” I then researched further and found on usgs dot gov “Depths to 300 feet have been measured near the Dallas, Oregon.” 

I then searched for the deepest river in the US, and was met with every single site (though none reliable like USGS) claiming the Hudson River is the deepest river in the US, with a maximum depth of 216 feet.

So what is it? Is the Congo the deepest river in the world at 720 feet or is it actually the Columbia River at 1,000 feet? Is the deepest river in the US the Hudson River at 216 feet? Or is it the Columbia at 1,000 or 300 feet? Or do we not actually know the answers?
