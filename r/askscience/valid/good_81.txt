Title: How is hydrogen created in our universe? 
Post Text: After learning that hydrogen is the most abundant and is the lightest element in the universe, my mind instantly started racing about how the inevitable movement of the universe is towards refinement. Idk if there’s a better word for it. I guess I’d like to know if it’s a matter of hydrogen being so abundant since the Big Bang, or if there’s some larger process that I don’t know of which leads to the abundance of hydrogen. 
Thanks!
