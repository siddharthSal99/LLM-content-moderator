Title: How did an aquatic rodent(beaver), obstinately not that "intelligent" by mammal terms end up evolving such a complex behavior like the ability to build dams? 
Post Text: I know enough of evolution to know its a very gradual process of "steps". Benefical traits in context of an organisms day to day survival and reproduction tend to slowly accumulate over time whilst detimental traits to that tend to be removed. How does a process, like this lead to such complex engineering instincts? A lot must go into building a damn for starters location, how do they know an ideal spot to build a dam? How do they decide the exact spot to construct? How can they so expertly engineer their own enviroment to that extent? What was the spesific evolutionary "path" that was took that made a small aquatic mammal so adept and hydroengineering?

In a sense im confused as how evolution a process of "Eh good enough" changes spesifically creates such a complex behavior as dam building? Like what were the beneficial steps that lead to it? Presumably there had to be, or beavers wouldn't be doing this?
