Title: How would we know if we were moving at near light speeds? 
Post Text: If I am walking 5km/h in a train that is moving 100km/h I'm really moving 105km/h relative to the earth. But the earth is moving 107,000 km/h relative to the sun so in a way I'm moving 107105km/h. But our solar system is moving 200,000km/s through the milky way so add that also... etc, etc etc.  
Now I realize that the speed of light is the fastest anything can move. And I know that time changes depending on the speed you are going. But I have also been led to believe that the object that is moving at great speed is experiencing time slower than those moving slower, yet to the object itself time still seems to move the same while the outside world form its perspective seems to speed up.

  
1. Since speed is relative and there is no fixed point to use as a speed of zero, if a planet was already moving at near light speed relative to another point in space how would its inhabitants even know that they were moving that fast?

  
2. If I, along with my world, was already moving this fast would my interpretation of light speed still just be an additional 300,000km/s relative to me?

  
3. What does this mean for the passage of time on other planets that are moving at a different speed through the universe relative to Earth?
