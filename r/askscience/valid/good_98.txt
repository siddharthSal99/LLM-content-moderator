Title: As human bodies develop, what establishes the orientation and placement eyelashes adopt, to end up the way they need to be: all aligned and growing out away from the eye, not randomly oriented or growing into the eye? 
Post Text: I understand that cells differentiate as an animal develops, but how can this get things like eyelashes oriented the way they need to be? I could visualize how one developing hair follicle might establish an orientation for the next one to align with, leading to hair whorls and to unique fingerprints.  But how is the first one not random?  How do you get to eyelashes that line up in a single parallel row, sticking out to form a fence that keeps things out of the eye? Is there something about how the tissue that forms the inside of they eyelid, meets the tissue that forms the outside of the eyelid, that forces an orientation of the eyelash follicles?

How does the body keep getting parts oriented properly, long after the first couple divisions of the egg has established bilateral symmetry?
