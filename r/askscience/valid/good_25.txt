Title: How does writing on paper work? Why can pencils and pens, 'stain' paper while it doesn't do the same to other materials? 
Post Text: I know it sounds simple, but what makes for paper being such an ideal writing surface? Are there tiny holes in the paper than hold on to graphite and ink? Why can't we write on pvc for example?
