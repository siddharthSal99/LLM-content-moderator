Title: Why do some colanders have asymmetrically distributed drain holes? (see picture) 
Post Text: Most colanders have drain holes distributed in radially symmetrical pattern clumps, however the distribution of the holes within the clump itself sometimes isn't symmetrical. To better illustrate my point here is a handy diagram: [Link](https://i.imgur.com/aYhJSSW.png)

I don't know how common this is, however I've seen it on enough colanders that there has to be some sort of reason for it and its not just a random decision/manufacturing error. Does such pattern possibly create a slight whirlpool in the draining water, thus making the drainage faster? Has the reason for this ever been mentioned in a text before?
