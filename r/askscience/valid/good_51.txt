Title: Why is silver-iodide specifically used for cloud seeding ? 
Post Text: Silver iodide (AgI) is a chemical used for cloud seeding. My question is why is AgI specifically used for this purpose and not any other chemical. What's the advantage of AgI over other materials ? And are there viable alternatives to this AgI ?
