Title: By what mechanism do paper towels absorb oils? 
Post Text: So assuming a paper towel is primarily cellulose, I understand that cellulose is rich in carboxyl groups that allow for cohesive forces with water and therefore absorb it through capillary action, but what about oil? From what I understand nonpolar cellulose regions are only exposed if the cellulose undergoes hydrolysis, so where do oils get cohesive interactions from a paper towel?
