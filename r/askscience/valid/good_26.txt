Title: When neurons fire without external input (like when we remember something) where are they getting their energy from? 
Post Text: I've just started Goldstein's Sensation and Perception (11th edition) and have been reading through visual processing. So far, my understanding is that our eyes convert energy from the environment (transduction) and this beautiful electrical, chemical dance happens within us to give us what we perceive.

However, I also just read that simply having a memory of a particular object can fire the SAME neurons as when we actually see that object. Where are those memory-influenced neurons getting their energy from?

I also understand some neurons are self-excitable, but aren't those for more involuntary processes like heartrate? 

The brain is incredible!

Thank you.
