Title: How do space scientists take signals from space and create sound? Like, how can we "hear" bodies in space when those bodies are in a vacuum? 
Post Text: My question revolves around the idea that space is silent because it is in a vacuum? I recently saw this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BeAmazed/comments/176h1mh/nasa\_shares\_an\_audio\_clip\_capturing\_the\_sound\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeAmazed/comments/176h1mh/nasa_shares_an_audio_clip_capturing_the_sound_of/)

and have seen multiple posts in the past of the "sounds of space" like stars, and the moon.

My limited knowledge on this subject is really basic. Obviously every body in the universe has a "frequency" but how are space scientists creating sound out of it? and why is it useful?
