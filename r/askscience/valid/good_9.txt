Title: Explanation for physical reaction to certain noises? 
Post Text: Like the classic intolerance to nails on a chalkboard, mine is squeaky rubber. Like wet shoes on a tile floor, balloon animals being made, and absolutely worst of all, my toddler chewing on his pacifier. 

It is excruciating. It causes a horrible physical sensation in my ears, teeth, and brain. Like being electrocuted, vibrating, and kinda tickles in a horrible way. Itâ€™s intense and comes in waves for at least a minute after the sound stops. 

Anyone else experience this or know why this happens??
