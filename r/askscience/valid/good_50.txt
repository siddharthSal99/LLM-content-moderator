Title: How do we know that Neanderthals and Denisovans were another species and not just another race of H. Sapiens Sapiens? 
Post Text: When I was growing up I was taught that species were classified based on different populations’ ability to produce viable offspring, which made sense to me until I learned about Zorses, Ligers, wolf-Foxes, puma-ocelots, chicken-peafowl (peacocks! Srsly nature is nasty) and so on. Learning that trans genus trans family and sometimes trans order hybrids were possible blew my mind, and left me with difficult questions about how and why we classify animals. To keep it simple I’ll stick with this one: what makes Neanderthals a different species? Is it genetic? Behavioral? Is it because of how long ago we branched?
