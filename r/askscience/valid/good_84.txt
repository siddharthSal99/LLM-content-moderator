Title: Why is the moon not lit up during an eclipse? 
Post Text: I’ve been paying attention to the moon lately. I’ve notice that the moon alot of the time you can see it during the day time.  You can see the craters and everything during the day time. 

So my question is, if the moon doesn’t produce is own light and the sun is what give the moon the right amount of light so you can see it, how come during a solar eclipse the sun is right behind it but you can’t see any details of the moon? the moon was pitch black.
