Title: What is the protoplasm of a cell? 
Post Text: I saw a picture that said the protoplasm is the collection of the cell membrane, the cytoplasm, and the nucleus, and that the cytoplasm is everything in the cell except the nucleus (until now I thought it was just the liquid everything was suspended in and didn't include the organelles). By that definition, isn't the protoplasm just the cell? at least in a cell without a cell wall that description includes every single part of a cell, so what's even the point of the word protoplasm? I also keep seeing it described as colourless when I thought nuclei were little black dots or something. Maybe those were just stains used to colour the nuclei for microscopy videos
