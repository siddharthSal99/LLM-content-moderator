Title: AskScience AMA Series: I'm Stanford Professor Dr David Spiegel. I've used clinical hypnosis to treat over 5,000 people - overcoming trauma, managing pain, and quitting unwanted habits. I co-wrote a paper w/ Dr A. Huberman on how cyclic sighing effectively reduces stress and anxiety. AMA! 
Post Text: Hello Reddit, I'm Dr David Spiegel. I'm Willson Professor and Associate Chair of Psychiatry &amp; Behavioral Sciences, and Director of the Center on Stress and Health and the Center for Integrative Medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine.

I have spent fifty years researching the impacts of hypnosis in a medical setting, treating over 5,000 patients. I have published thirteen books and 425 scientific journal articles on hypnosis, psychosocial oncology, trauma, psychotherapy for stress, anxiety, and depression. The results we have been documenting with hypnosis in relation to a wide range of challenges - like healing pain, overcoming trauma, maximising productivity, managing eating habits, quitting smoking, and going sober - are incredible. I truly believe that if hypnosis were a drug, we'd see it across every hospital in the US.

I'm here today to demystify and dispel some of the rumours and myths around hypnosis, showing how incredible and valuable hypnosis is as a tool for significant change. AMA about [cyclic sighing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYYLZA3-VRI), [hypnotizability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8fPExRLX2s), [managing chronic pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYYLZA3-VRI), stress, and neuroscience. I'm equally happy to share insights on any other topics I've mentioned above.

I am also working with a wonderful team to build our app, Reveri, where we share the transformative effects of hypnosis with users around the world. The feedback and data we're receiving from our app matches with the impact and results seen with in-person hypnotherapy. If you'd like to try self-hypnosis, you can [download Reveri here](https://linktr.ee/reverihealth).

(To save everyone a question, no, [I'm not this Dr Spiegel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IwUlKPSVQs&amp;pp=ygULZHIgc3BpZWdlbCA%3D).)

I'll be replying to questions on today starting at 10am PST / 1pm EST / 6pm BST

AMA - I'm excited to take your questions; thank you for having me!
