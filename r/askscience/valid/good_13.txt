Title: Dating fossils of a burrowing animal? 
Post Text: I was watching the Budget Museum's youtube video "Dinosaurs of the Mountains" and it was mentioning that there was an abundance of these Oryctodromeus fossils in the Wayan formation because they seemed to be burrowing dinosaurs which would be well preserved when their burrows collapsed. It got me wondering, how accurately can you date a burrowing animal if its burrow is going into older and older strata in the geologic record? Would you hope to find the "top" of the burrow or some sort of infill from a higher layer?
