Title: Would a species like the horseshoe crab which has been around since the time of the dinosaurs still instinctively fear that which preyed on them millions of years ago? 
Post Text: I had a hard time expressing my question in the title so I'm sorry if it isn't clear. 



Would an animal which has existed in a largely unchanged state as long as the horseshoe crabs have still fear animals which used to prey on them but went extinct millions of years ago? If so how long does that instinctive fear take to go away? How long does an instinctive fear take to evolve? 



I know that a lot of the animals which prey on horseshoe crabs are also animals which have been around for a long time like sharks, turtles, and alligators but I'm just using them as an example. 



Alternatively, would say a species of shark which used to feed on a type of fish which went extinct millions of years ago still pursue it as prey if that shark encountered one today? 



I'm really interested to learn more about predator/prey relationships and how the vastness of time effects it.
