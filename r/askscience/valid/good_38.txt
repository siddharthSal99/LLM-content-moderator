Title: We are scientists from the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology coming to you from our annual meeting in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA! We study fossils. Ask Us Anything! 
Post Text: Hi /r/AskScience! We are members of the [**Society of Vertebrate Paleontology**](http://vertpaleo.org/), here for our **10th annual AMA**. We study fossil fish, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles — anything with a backbone! Our research includes how these organisms lived, how they were affected by environmental change like a changing climate, how they're related, and much more. You can **follow us on ~~Twitter~~ X @SVP_vertpaleo**.

Joining us today are:

**Matt Borths, Ph.D.** (/u/Chapalmalania) is the Curator of Fossils at the [Duke Lemur Center](https://lemur.duke.edu/) at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. His research focuses on the evolution of carnivorous mammals and primates, especially in Africa and North America. He is also part of several teams working to network natural history collections. Dr. Borths co-produced the paleontology podcast series Past Time (www.pasttime.org).

**Clint Boyd, Ph.D.** (/u/PalaeoBoyd) is the Curator of the North Dakota State Fossil Collection and the Paleontology Program Manager for the North Dakota Geological Survey. His research focuses on the evolutionary history of ornithischian dinosaurs and studying Eocene and Oligocene faunae from the Great Plains region of North America. Find him on X @boydpaleo.

**Stephanie Drumheller, Ph.D.** (/u/UglyFossils) is a paleontologist at the University of Tennessee whose research focuses on the processes of fossilization, evolution, and biology, of crocodiles and their relatives, including identifying bite marks on fossils. Find her on X @UglyFossils.

**Ashley Hall** (/u/vertpaleoama) is the Outreach Program Manager at the Museum of the Rockies in Montana. She has a wide-ranging experience in paleontology, from science education to working in museum collections to fieldwork. She is also the author of *Fossils for Kids: a Junior Scientist’s Guide to Dinosaur Bones, Ancient Animals, and Prehistoric Life on Earth.*

**Mindy Householder** (/u/mindles1308) is a fossil preparator with the State Historical Society of North Dakota. She has cleaned and repaired many fossil specimens for public museums and institutions over the past 18 years. Some well known specimens she worked on include “Jane” the juvenile *Tyrannosaurus rex* and “Dakota” the *Edmontosaurus* sp. fossilized natural mummy.

**Hannah Maddox** (/u/Hannahdactylus) is a Master's student from the University of Tennessee studying taphonomy and vertebrate paleontology. She is here at her first SVP to present on a new unusual theropod dinosaur from the Hell Creek Formation. 

**Josh Miller, Ph.D.** (/u/PaleoJosh) is a paleoecologist and Assistant Professor at the University of Cincinnati. His research focuses on Pleistocene paleoecology, taphonomy, and using fossil and subfossil records to help conserve and manage modern ecosystems (Conservation Paleobiology). Find out more at JoshuaHMiller.com.

**Jennifer Nestler, M.S.** (/u/jnestler) is an ecologist who uses quantitative methods to tackle paleontological and biological questions and inform conservation decisions. She works on the morphology and ecology of fossil and modern crocodylians, and has also looked at bite marks, biases in field collection methods, and landscape-level modeling.

**Melissa Pardi, Ph.D.** (/u/MegafaunaMamMel) is a paleontologist and the Curator of Geology at the Illinois State Museum in Springfield, IL, USA. Her research focus is the paleoecology of Quaternary mammals, including their diets and geographic distributions.

**Adam Pritchard, Ph.D.** (/u/vertpaleoama) is the Assistant Curator of Paleontology at the Virginia Museum of Natural History in Martinsville, VA. His research focuses on the evolution of reptiles during the Permian and Triassic periods, a time of great change that saw the rise of the dinosaurs. Please check out the Virginia Museum of Natural History at vmnh.net. Dr. Pritchard has also co-produced the paleontology podcast series Past Time, available at www.pasttime.org.
