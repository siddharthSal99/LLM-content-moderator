Title: When immature (human) eggs die, where do they physically go? 
Post Text: I've always heard that women are born with all the eggs they'll ever have, and I (24F) assumed that that meant like..... 500 eggs? Because there's 1 per menstrual cycle for 40ish years. 

I feel very silly now because apparently female fetuses have MILLIONS of eggs and we lose them over time. From what I'm reading, girls are born with around 1-2 million, and then by puberty have around 300,000-400,000 left, and then post-puberty about 1,000/month die. 

My question is: what actually happens to the cells? Every written-for-laypeople article that I can find just says that X amount of immature eggs die per month, but where do the cells go? Do they stay dead in the ovary? Are they shedded as part of menstruation? Or do they get broken down and reabsorbed into the body somehow... (?) 

Thanks for helping! Everything I can easily find online is either a pop-science article that skims over this question or a super technical description that means nothing to me.
