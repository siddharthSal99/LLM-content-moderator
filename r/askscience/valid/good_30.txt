Title: Is there any evidence of animals developing - or beginning to develop - an additional heart? 
Post Text: Hearts are rather important to animals, and a "backup" would certainly be nice to have. Perhaps they are *too* important, such that mutations which would potentially lead towards an eventual second heart would too often be fatal and so we never see it develop?

Anyway, thanks for your time!
