Title: How is it that temperate rainforests exist within proximity of cold ocean currents? 
Post Text: From what I understand, warm ocean currents carry moisture and cold ocean currents carry nutrients.  So how do the western coasts of both North and South America, which are in proximity to an ocean current, get enough rain to form rainforests comparable to the Amazon or Congo?
