Title: Why didn't American Diseases kill Europeans? 
Post Text: Diseases that killed historically

This maybe a weird question,  but I got to thinking about it yesterday. I have always read about the tens of thousands of Native Americans killed by unfamiliar diseases  introduced by Europeans coming the North America. However I have never heard of a disease that was Native to the America's killing massive amounts of Europeans.  Why?
