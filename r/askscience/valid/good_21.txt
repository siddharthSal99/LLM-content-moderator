Title: Does the speed of light only account for the velocity of the photon or does it include the oscillations of the particle as well? 
Post Text: I thought about this while walking my dog today and had no idea which answer is correct. I'd assume that most scientific tools could only measure a Photon's velocity, especially when the speed of light was first discovered in the Michelson-Morley experiment, but if that was the case wouldn't the oscillation of a photon provide a small incremental boost to the overall speed of the photon? But if the speed of light does account for the oscillation then wouldn't the distance that light travels be less than it's overall speed?

I'm not sure what the answer to my question is, more than likely it's nonsense haha. Would love to be informed.
