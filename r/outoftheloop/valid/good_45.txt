Title: What’s the deal with the Netflix’s Squid Game reality show hate? 
Post Text: I’ve been seeing a lot of people critique the trailer of the new show for being tone deaf (https://x.com/jessicobra/status/1716918825747353717?s=46&amp;t=oKLWvC7kaQYiMMFXkqUTVg), but isn’t this just like any other reality competition show that has been on for the past 20 - 30 years now. Am I missing something?
