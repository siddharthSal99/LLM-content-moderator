Title: What’s the deal with digital circus pilot becoming so popular so quickly? 
Post Text: So I was browsing YouTube and I see this animation

 I recognized that it’s the same studio of murder drones so I check it out and then i see that the pilot of digital circus has 15 million views in less of a week , I guess it shares some crew members from hazbin hotel / helluva boss which are both very popular and so it’s GLITCH but I can’t really wrap my head around how it managed to get this popular this quickly
