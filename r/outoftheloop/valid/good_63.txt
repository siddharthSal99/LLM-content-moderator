Title: What’s going on with Wendee Lee and the Bleach anime? 
Post Text: I’m seeing a lot of chatter on Twitter about Wendee Lee dunking on other voice actors, and I have no idea what’s going on. Apparently it has something to do with her being recast? I don’t know anything about Bleach, I just know Wendee Lee from playing TK in the old Digimon dub. And I’ve heard some less than stellar things about her attitude, including her directing style in the booth, but I can’t pin down where I heard those rumors.

There’s this tweet with some screenshots of what she said, but they’re lacking in specificity:

but she’s deleted most of her other tweets, so I’m not able to get a fuller picture of what she said.

Edit: A lot of voice actors on Twitter seem to be up in arms but none of them are specifically explaining what happened and I can’t seem to get the full picture from the screenshots they’re posting.
