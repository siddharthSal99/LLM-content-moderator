*Just click on any post. Dick sucking inside joke punch line inevitable*

What the question says. I wanted to complain about how they never toss the spicier wings properly. Take them off the damn menu! I used to go like once a month until my wild sauce wings had next to no suace on them FOUR~FIVE times in a row 

You can’t post there anymore. At least I couldn’t. And there hasn’t been a new post in 37 days

I googled dick sucking bww but that didn’t go how I’d like when I’m off private mode

Ps y’all got one of the automods of all time
