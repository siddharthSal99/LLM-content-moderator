Title: What's up with all the anti-Israeli suppoet online all of a sudden?

Using the responses to the POTUS account's tweet as an example, I get that it may be a bit of cherry picking here but just to show what I'm talking about.

At the beginning of the war a lot of people were pro-Israel, but these last few weeks (I assume after the hospital, was it?) there's a lot of pro-Palestine support. Which whatever right, I get in any conflict there's gonna be supporters on both sides, but I see a lot of people online claiming that America's funding a genocide and I've even seen some people call for the Israeli people to leave the region. Support in a much more extreme way.

I'm just confused as to what has caused this sudden pouring in of anti-Israeli sentiment. I can't condone the actions of either side, it's brutal both ways, but I genuinely don't know what's caused such a widespread anti-Israeli - and anti-Semitic in some cases - feelings online.

(I can definitely blame this on me not following the news, so if you're wondering why it seems like I don't know much about the conflict it's because I don't. Which is my bad, but it's hard to follow with such widespread division I feel. If this is gonna spark a huge political debate I'm just gonna delete this, I'm not here to debate anything, that's not what this sub is for)
