Title: What's the deal with people using the word regarded instead of the slur? 
Post Text: This confuses me a bit because the intents of the people using this as a substitute for the slur, are to use the slur just under a new word , so if their intent is the same they shouldn't care, so why don't they just use the slur?

Why did this trend start? New censorship on major platforms?  
I don't like the word but this is saying it with intent under another word, it is ridiculous
