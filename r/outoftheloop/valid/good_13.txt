Title: What's going on with /r/therewasanattempt having "From the River to the Sea" flair on every new post? 
Post Text: [Every post from the last 24 hours has that flair.](https://old.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/)

I always thought that sub was primarily for memes but it seems that has changed now that every post is required to have that flair. Prior to the recent mainstream attention of the Israel/Hamas war, no posts on that sub had that flair. [A mod of the sub recently announced new rules, including it being a bannable offense to speak against Palestine](https://www.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/comments/17eql3v/announcing_a_new_rules_list_for_rtherewasanattempt/)

Are large subreddits like this allowed to force users to promote certain political beliefs such as "From the River to the Sea"?
