Title: What's up with all the memes about the band Creed and people secretly liking them? 
Post Text: Hey all,

Lately I've noticed an up tick in memes and reels about people initially making fun of the band Creed but the punch line of the post is that the person secretly likes them like in this [post](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CxRBkkGueNK/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) and a search on Instagram shows many more like it, like telling your neighbours to turn down Creed but then hiding behind the curtains singing along or playing a video of theirs on the new Las Vegas [Sphere ](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CyT4GwSOwVq/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) .

I always thought Creed were on par with Nickleback in regards to their popularity and people didn't like them.

Is this just people making fun of them or are they actually popular?
