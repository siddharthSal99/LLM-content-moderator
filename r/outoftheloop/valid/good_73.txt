Title: Whats going on with the subreddit r/Comics being dominated by seemingly one user? 
Post Text: Everyday when I scroll through r/popular or r/all at work I see these comic posts all from the same user. All depict the artist (a woman) doing mundane tasks, with a punchline that appears to be some sort of recurring joke. I don't think I have the highest standards for humor, but I haven't found any of the posts funny in the slightest. They all look to be as if they are part of an elaborate inside joke that I am not apart of.
  

  

  

  
My question would be, who is this artist, and how has she developed a cult following on Reddit? So much so that her posts reach the front page daily, and I rarely ever see a different user's post get so much exposure?
