Title: What's going on with people losing their jobs over the Hamas War? 
Post Text:  I saw this article on The Cut about how people are losing their jobs over their views with the current war  in Israel. Most of these people are Pro Palestinians, yet their bosses are Jewish. Can someone explain to me why this is happening and why now is there a big backlash here in America? Am trying to read information about this am just getting more confused.
