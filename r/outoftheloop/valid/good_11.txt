Title: “What’s the deal with” why do upvotes sometimes freeze and load paid yellow cartoon upvotes, and other times not work at all? 
Post Text: I know the obvious answer is, the app sucks, but this looks like a very deliberate thing. 

Some posts don’t allow you to upvote at all unless you use one of the paid cartoon upvotes that take about 20 seconds to load. The app freezes while they load.

Some posts don’t allow you to upvote them all all, I can sit and tap on that arrow all day and it does nothing. 

Does the sub decide this? Does it happen for everyone or am I just special on my outdated iPhone?
