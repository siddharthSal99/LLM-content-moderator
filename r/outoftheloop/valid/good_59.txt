Title: What's going on with r/all? Why am I suddenly seeing a bunch of gore? 
Post Text: Has the algorithm or the rules for r/all changed recently? This used to happen almost never. Maybe once every couple of months. But today I saw at least four different gore posts on r/all

I've already had to block r/nope, r/medicalgore and r/makemesuffer and I'll keep blocking subreddits as they appear. But if this is just going to be a thing on reddit going forward, I might have to step away. I don't need this stuff in my life.

As per the rules of this subreddit I have to include links, so here are the posts I'm talking about. I don't recommend clicking on them:
