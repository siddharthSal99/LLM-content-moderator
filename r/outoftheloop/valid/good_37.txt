Title: What's going on with the Surrey, BC police transition? 
Post Text: I keep seeing news about the province and the city of Surrey [battling it out](https://www.surrey.ca/news-events/news/city-of-surrey-launches-court-proceeding-halt-police-transition), going as far as [amending the law](https://bc.ctvnews.ca/province-passes-legislation-to-end-surrey-policing-saga-1.6618103) to get a better legal stance. Why is this so controversial? Do residents not want local policing?
