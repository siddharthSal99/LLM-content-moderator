Title: Why have people been talking about how to pronounce ".gif" again? 
Post Text: I thought this was settled at least a decade ago. People argued about this back in like 2005, the guy who invented the word said it had a J sound and everyone went on with their lives. 

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/17igjdl/tell_jod_i_was_right/) is the 3rd or 4th argument I've seen hit the front page in the last day or so. Why do people suddenly care about this again? Why doesn't anyone remember the actual answer? And Why do people thing the pronunciation of "graphics" has anything to do with the pronunciation of "gif"?
