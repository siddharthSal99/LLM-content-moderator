Title: What’s going on with Hezbollah? 
Post Text: With talk about the Israel Hamas war expanding to a broader regional conflict, I’d like to understand the conditions that created Hezbollah in Lebanon and not other Israeli neighbors?

Why didn’t something like Hezbollah appear in other neighboring Arab states of Israel like Syria, Jordan or Egypt? Why Lebanon?

Why do Jordan and Egypt have (from my understanding) decent relations with Israel and Lebanon doesn’t?
