Title: What’s up with The Digital Circus? 
Post Text: I’ve seen the main character jester all over social media, especially Reddit, over the past week, it seems the first episode of the web animation series it’s from was only uploaded 5 days ago. Yet it already has 12m views and has everyone talking about it and apparently there’s even a plush? Does anyone know why it’s such a big deal?
