Title: Why are people talking about Kingdom of Heaven all of a sudden? 
Post Text: For the last 2 months or so I’ve been seeing edits like this one for the Ridley Scott movie Kingdom of Heaven. Specifically involving the film’s portrayal of King Baldwin IV of Jerusalem. Why is this almost 20 year old movie resurging in meme and edit culture now? Did something happen in the news that made people nostalgic for a fictionalized portrayal of a crusader king?
