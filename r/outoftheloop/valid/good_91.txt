Title: What's going on with Norway and the protesting of wind turbines? 
Post Text: [It seems to have something to do with indigenous people and reindeer â€“ and Greta Thunberg now, too.](https://apnews.com/article/norway-wind-turbines-sami-herders-protest-c97371074db742c0654da522c5a9f379)

What's the history of these protests? 

I've also been seeing things online about concerns that the vibrations are affecting the animals, somehow. Is this just pseudo-scientific hogwash? And if so, is it specific to this protest or is it a common "argument" against wind power in other countries, as well?
