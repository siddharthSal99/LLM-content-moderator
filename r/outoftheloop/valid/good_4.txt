I saw this article on a conservative subreddit and wanted more info. Are these just random people that are not a big deal? Are they actually security risks and DHS is doing a bad job? In addition to this it said in there that like 42,000 Chinese nationals went across the US Mexico border which idk why they would be at that border crossing. I also saw that Chinese nationals were apparently infiltrating military bases or something?
