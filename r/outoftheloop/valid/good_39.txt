Title: What's going on with Israel's PM being blamed for the attack? 
Post Text: So I saw the poll on reuters and apparently 80% voted that the attack was on the fault of Israel's PM. I do know that they were taken by surprise during the attack, but I still haven't found any explanation on why he is blamed for the attack. Most  argument i've seen here is that "the government should have been more prepared" but from my current pov, that seems like victim blaming isn't it? It's like those arguments that goes "Oh, you got SA'd? You should have dressed better then." Would love for someone shedding some light on this one.
