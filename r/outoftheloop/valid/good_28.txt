Title: What's going on with the Palestine-Israel-Middle East area? 
Post Text: I feel like I need to pay for a master's degree in history to understand the powers and religions brewing in that area. It feels like everyone already understands why everything is happening, and I'm coming into the fire with a pizza of ignorance. Many of my teachers touched on it in class, but I'm not satisfied with the details. If this ever ends, I hope a textbook is written lols

If it helps to explain, I'm an atheist. So, the different religious sectors and sub-sectors/cults are confusing, since I don't pay too much attention to religion. But from here: [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/9/whats-the-israel-palestine-conflict-about-a-simple-guide](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/9/whats-the-israel-palestine-conflict-about-a-simple-guide) My understanding of this is that Jewish people were forced onto Palestinian land and lots of blood was shed getting the Palestinians to obey and let Jews onto their land. Then, Israel became a Jewish state and further forced Palestinians to live in squalid horror, (Is Israel still a Jewish state?) and continued to attack Palestinians.

Then, people are angry if we support Hamas-Israel because it means supporting terrorism, and angry if we support Palestine because that means supporting antisemitism, right? Please correct me lol I'm not 100% sure who the characters in this conflict are and their religious affiliations. I'm also curious about the differences between all the religious groups in the Middle East and why they all hate each other but I think that's an extremely long history lesson for later lol

Edit: Thanks for the reeducation lol, I was completely wrong about all the characters. So many articles skip over why each character exists and what stance they take, and some don't go back far enough. I'll take this foundation to research a little further for my own curiosity.
