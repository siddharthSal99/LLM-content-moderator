Title: Why are people talking about Travis Kelce so much, who is this guy? 
Post Text: I gather he's some sort of football player, but there are lots of football players.  Why is he suddenly so popular and showing up in news articles that aren't even related to football?  (I just read an article about candy corn that mentioned his name.  https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/30/business/candy-corn-brachs/index.html) Now it looks like he's got some sort of reality TV show?  Who is this guy?  Two weeks ago I'd never heard of him, now he's everywhere.
