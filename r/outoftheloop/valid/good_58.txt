Title: What is going on with my feed being overrun with bots? Why am I seeing posts with 0 upvotes in "Best"?

^ This will probably be deleted by the time you see it since it breaks that sub's rules. I've seen this exact fake screenshot of Musk shilling some shitcoin about 12 times now (mostly in r/godot for some reason). I'm also seeing youtubers spamming their videos in unrelated subreddits (a lot of them are AI generated).

These posts have 0 upvotes as far as I can see. I'm not browsing new to find them, they're showing up on my home page. I've genuinely been seeing more bot posts, spam and reposts than actual posts from real users and relevant to the subreddits now. It's getting fucking unbearable. Is this happening to anyone else? Did the botters find some exploit to get their content seen? How the fuck are posts with 0 upvotes BEST in any way?
