Title: What's the deal with "those Rui fans" to those deeper into Porject SEKAI's fandom than I am? 
Post Text: I see [mentions of "those Rui fans" so often when I'm scrolling through TikTok](https://imgur.com/a/EgwljA2) and as someone who doesn't dive deep into the fandom as well as someone with autism and thus a lower chance of getting the hint in people's words, it's driving me crazy as to what's being implied by it. The posts I see don't even give enough context. Like the TikTok in my provided screenshot (that I censored out courtesy of the cosplayer, so I don't unintentionally drag them into some kind of crazy fan war; I know, very paranoid for an r/OutOfTheLoop query, but I'd rather be safe than sorry given how psycho some fans can be in their fandoms, the reason I don't get deep into fandoms anymore which brings us to why I'm here at all) talks about a headcanon while others are like "cakes I'd give to these stans" and the "THOSE Rui stans" slide had a disgusting cake (one which seems overblown for just a simple headcanon that may mischaracterize Rui) and the "explanation" of "you know who you are," so that's not helpful. I just would like to understand (despite my bias being towards Mafuyu personally, so this doesn't affect me much aside from one of my ship biases being MafuRui) because I see it so much and it's frustrating for me to not be able to "get it" because my autism brain goes brr at the hint of needing to read in between the lines.
