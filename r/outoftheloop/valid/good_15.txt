Title: What’s going on with the Brighton Park immigration camp? 
Post Text: Hi i saw a tweet about Asian Americans protesting against it and how this is the result of Bidens policies. That led me to this article (https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/chicago/news/brighton-park-neighbors-protest-tent-camp-alderwoman/) which still leaves me a bit confused tbh. Is this because of Biden’s immigration policies? Are these migrants that the Texas governor sent again? Would love more information.
