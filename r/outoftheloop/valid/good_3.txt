Title: What's going on with all the [removed] comments on r/PublicFreakout? 
Post Text: Anyone who frequents that sub (on the mobile app at least) will be able to see so many \[removed\] comments on all posts.  
I then noticed that my comments on that sub always remain at 1 upvote with no replies. I anonymously browse the subreddit to view my comments and realise that my comments too have been \[removed\] with no explanation.  
So why are there so many removed comments on that sub?

EDIT: The mods have replied to this post stating that it has to do with something called CQS, which is detailed in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/s/S61HG8xKdy) and [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/s/rwNnljbZJx).
