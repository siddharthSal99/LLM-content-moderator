Title: What’s up with this repeating the same thing different ways meme? 
Post Text: Repeating the same thing different ways meme?

I’m starting to see a meme format now where they repeat the same thing different ways over and over. What’s this about?

My first assumption is it’s a parody of those clickbait videos/articles where they repeat the same thing until they get to the point.

Example:
Did you know? Daisy is a playable character in the new Mario game! Wow. This is important because the new Mario game is the first time Daisy is a playable character. So cool!

What would you even call this meme format?
