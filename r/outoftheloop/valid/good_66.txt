Title: What's going on with the negativity in Instagram Reels comment sections? 
Post Text: In the past year or so I've noticed Instagram Reels comments have become absolutely terrible. 

For example a video of a little girl skateboarding will get bunch of comments about trans athletes that have nothing to do with the video. A clip of a big dog and a kid playing together will have comments saying it's animal and/or child abuse. A comedy skit made by a black person will have bunch of comments making slavery "jokes" completely unrelated to the original skit. ADHD awareness video will get bunch of comments accusing the poster of "faking having new trendy mental illness" or just outright saying ADHD isn't real. Even something as mundane as somebody seen holding a Nintendo controller will get bunch of hate comments about how they're a loser and PC/Xbox/PlayStation Is better. 

It didn't use to be that way, did the algorithm change? Like is content being recommended to the wrong people? Or did comment moderation change or what?
