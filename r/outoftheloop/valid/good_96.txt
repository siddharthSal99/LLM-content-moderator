Title: What's up with r/iama being so empty? 
Post Text: There's basically a post a day in a subreddit of 22.6m people. There's a pinned post saying the mods are going to moderate less and reach out to less celebrities following the whole reddit carfaffel:
     
https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14nte7z/mod_post_the_future_of_iama/?share_id=6ARZcdpYQ704xkfSlvreO&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1
    
But that still doesn't explain. Are 22.6m redditors in on disengaging from the sub?
