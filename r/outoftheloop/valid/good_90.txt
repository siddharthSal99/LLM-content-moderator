Title: What's up with people on GameFAQS saying the site's days are numbered after its longtime owner announced he is stepping down? 
Post Text: I haven't been on GameFAQS in a loooong time but recently went there only to find [this](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/6-gamefaqs-announcements/80595955) announcement.  Obviously, this has caused all the related message boards to react with alot of them saying that the site's pretty much disappearing soon.

Now I know that GameFAQS is a really old site that hasn't physically changed in a long time.  And while I don't know who SBAllen is other than he took ownership of the place from the original owner 15+ years ago, I can understand the historical significance of this move.  

What I don't understand is insinuations that the site is not long for this world.  Are they just in-jokes or has something been happening since?  I did a cursory search and everyone's referencing an acquisition by Fandom but as to what policies they've enacted that could've been causing controversy I find myself lost.  

Can someone who is more versed in the site tell me what's going on?  I haven't been to this site in ages but it'd be a real shame to see a website from my childhood shrivel away.
