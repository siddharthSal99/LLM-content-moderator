Title: What's up with the higher than usual influx of [deleted] comments? 
Post Text: I noticed that on r/hmm, r/weird, and r/popculturechat.

I thought it was my impression, but I saw other people commenting too.

Sometimes the [deleted] comments are in reply to a comment or post I made myself, but I get no notification there was a new comment there to begin with.

Here's an example: https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/s/ipYrnG58td

So what's going on?

Edit: I should add that I started to notice what I mention in this thread around 3 days ago. Of course I've seen [deleted] comments before, just not this many. And I'd usually get a notification for them as well, which isn't happening.
