Title: What's up with this Taylor Swift concert movie being seen as such a game-changer, business-wise?

Big into movies, less so the box office stuff, and I know absolutely nothing about Swift. Her concert movie is making the rounds because of its gross and the fact it was self-distributed.  
  
Why did no studios take the chance to print money, since she's been a name for the last 15 years? Is the hype about saving theatres overblown? Have the studios shown themselves to be complacent or irrelevant? Will this affect streaming?
