Title: What is going on with people talking about how close World War 3 is? 
Post Text: So I generally try to stay away from the news. I am an anxious person by default and the news triggers that hard. Now I don't live in a hole I know about Isreal and Gaza though I don't know all the details or really what is going on to give a hard opinion on the matter.

However, today I was at work and a bunch of my co-workers were talking about WW3 and how close we are. When I asked questions they said that I should go read the news because it is starting soon. Within a month for sure.

As I was leaving work they were talking about how the department of travel has now announced a world wide travel advisory so when WW3 happens Americans aren't stuck over seas.

I was thinking about reading the news but don't want to go down a rabbit hole and stress myself out, it gets bad.
