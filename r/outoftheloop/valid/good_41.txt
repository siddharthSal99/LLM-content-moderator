Title: What’s the deal with Jeff Arcuri? 
Post Text: I’d literally never heard of this guy until maybe two weeks ago and now he’s on the front page of Reddit on a daily basis? I watched a couple of his clips (see recent one below) and they’re kinda meh in my opinion, not terrible but not exactly hilarious either. 

Is there something more to this whole phenomenon that I’m missing or is this website just so dead that a couple thousand dedicated fans upvoting his clips is enough to get him to the top every day?
