Title: What's the deal with the Canadian lady dressed as a fridge? Why did her post get lots of downvotes and then disappear? 
Post Text: [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/17gih18/for_halloween_2023_this_woman_dressed_as_a_6_foot/) seemed to have all the hallmarks of a happy, positive Halloween costume post. A few comments (including mine) were positive, but every time I checked, the upvotes seemed to be countered by at least as many downvotes (though it's hard for me to see that with modern reddit). And now the photo series is just gone.

Anyone know what happened?

*Edit*: Two answers, both of which seem reasonable. No other comments. I think this is as solved as it's going to get.
