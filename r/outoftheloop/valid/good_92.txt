Title: What's up with the recent usage of "Mideast" over "Middle East" in the news? 
Post Text: I've noticed that in recent news reports on the events in Israel, the word "Mideast" is used over "Middle East". Here's examples from 4 different outlets:

https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-hospital-jordan-egypt-protests-590f24d154fb3cb256ec1707ec78b816

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/17/israel-iran-hezbollah-wider-war/

https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/16/biden-blinken-diplomacy-middle-east-00121829

https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/in-chinas-calls-for-mideast-peace-hamas-assault-goes-unmentioned-b4e0c382

Middle East is still used sometimes in the article itself, but the usage of the word Mideast itself is something I've not seen up to the beginning of the conflict. Was there a new style guide for journalists released that dictates the use of Mideast or something?
