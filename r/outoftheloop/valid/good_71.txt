Title: What's the deal with Patrick Rothfuss and his next book? 
Post Text: So I stumbled across [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/16ycbve/comment/k38k771/) in an AskReddit thread on "Who abandoned their core audience and paid the price for it?"

&gt;Former author, current Twitch streamer and habitual liar and grifter; Patrick Rothfuss

Had decent number of replies so I figure SOMETHING is going on, but can't find much on Google aside from scattered forum posts that don't explain the whole story.

I like his books and stuff, but first I heard of anything going on.
