Title: What's going on with the Inquisitor Suicide and Tito? 
Post Text: I heard recently about the story and the false allegations, but something stuck with me... These allegations were formed by AJ and tito, yes? Where they lied about Inquisitor being 23 years old and a predator towards AJ who is17... But... Like... Tito is 20. AJ is 17. They are dating. In this situation where people lied about Inquisitor being a pedo one of the liars themselves were a pedo??? I haven't seen it talked about enough. People say no punishment is being served, which is true, we can't punish them for the false allegations... But why is there no attempt made to ruin the life Tito doesn't deserve? We can atleast take someone down, right?  
  
I'm just posting it here to make sure I am thinking right and in the loop with it.
