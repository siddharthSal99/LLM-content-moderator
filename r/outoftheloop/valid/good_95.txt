Title: What's up with everyone suddenly switching their stance to Pro-Palestine? 
Post Text: October 7 - October 12 everyone on my social media (USA) was pro israel. I told some of my friends I was pro palestine and I was denounced. 

Now everyone is pro palestine and people are even going to palestine protests

For example at Harvard, students condemned a pro palestine letter on the 10th: [https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/10/10/psc-statement-backlash/](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/10/10/psc-statement-backlash/)

Now everyone at Harvard is rallying to free palestine on the 15th: [https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/10/15/gaza-protest-harvard/](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/10/15/gaza-protest-harvard/)

I know it's partly because Israel ordered the evacuation of northern Gaza, but it still just so shocking to me that it was essentially a cancelable offense to be pro Palestine on October 10 and now it's the opposite. The stark change at Harvard is unreal to me I'm so confused.
