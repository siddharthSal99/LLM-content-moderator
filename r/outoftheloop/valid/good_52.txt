Title: What’s up with people saying it’s hard to find jobs? 
Post Text: I keep seeing people saying how tough the [job market](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/s/cbMBgskJgf) is and that it's very hard to find a job even though there are still a lot of unfilled jobs. Is this a matter of tech layoffs and now all of those people likely are competing for those jobs? Is it there are a lot of blue collar jobs no one wants? Just curious and confused so interested to hear what people have to say!
