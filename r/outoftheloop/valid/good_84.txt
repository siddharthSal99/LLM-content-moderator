Title: What’s going on with YouTube and people censoring “offensive” words? 
Post Text: Hello r/outoftheloop,

I seem to have missed something with YouTube and censorship. Lately while watching YouTube videos which for me are usually true crime or police interrogation videos and I’m noticing with new content posted in the last two months or so that words like sex, murder, stabbed etc are being censored with a beep? Did I miss something, why is this happening? My best guess is it’s some demonetization thing? 

Example is this Chris Hansen video where the word pedophile is censored: https://youtu.be/btRauW5fTEA?si=fS4zKYy5UMzQanXJ

Thanks!
