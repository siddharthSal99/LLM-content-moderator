Title: What's going on with the disproportionately high number of children deaths in Gaza? 
Post Text: Around 40% of the civilian deaths have been children. It's heartbreaking but what's the reason?  Just doesn't make sense. Is the child population that high? Can't find anything about it if it is. Just to clarify I'm not trying to insinuate anything.
