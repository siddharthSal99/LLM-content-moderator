Title: What is going on with Taylor Swift’s album “1989” and the re release “1989 (Taylor’s Version)”? 
Post Text: I understand she re released her album but is it the same album re recorded or is there a major  difference such as new songs, different lyrics, etc.? 

For the record I’m not a huge fan of hers (obviously), but I am curious about the motivation for this re release. Is it for sale revenue or is there some kind of statement she’s making? 

Anyway, thanks for your help in advance lovely people of Reddit ❤️
