Title: What is up with everyone using the worm emoji ðŸª± all of a sudden? 
Post Text: Recently while scrolling on Reddit and Instagram Iâ€™ve been seeing comments with seemingly normal text or jokes and one or two word emojis after it. I do not understand why this is or if Iâ€™m supposed to be imagining a worm. Any context would be awesome thanks! ðŸª±ðŸª±
