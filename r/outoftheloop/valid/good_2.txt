Title: What's going on with Keith Lee and Atlanta restaurants? 
Post Text: From what I can gather, he is a popular tiktoker who makes food reviews. I've seen a bunch of memes on twitter regarding some sort of controversy with restaurants/food service in Atlanta but can't seem to find the context. Would anyone care to explain?
