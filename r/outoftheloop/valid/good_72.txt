Title: What's the deal with needing the far right for Congress to choose a speaker? 
Post Text: I don't get it. The Republicans are too split to pick a speaker. Meanwhile, the Democrats are just hanging out on the sidelines with their protest votes for Jeffries. Why don't the Democrats just pick their favorite Republican and get some moderate Republicans to vote with them, or vice versa? Instead of appeasing the far right, everyone else could just leave them out of the conversation. This seems obvious, so I'm definitely missing something, I just don't know enough about politics to know what.
