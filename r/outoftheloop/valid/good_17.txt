Title: What's up with Kai Cenat being locked up? 
Post Text: I'm relatively aware of who Kai Cenat is and some of the content he's known for but I don't follow him. 

I've recently seen references to him being locked up, but it sounds like it's a prank/social experiment? Can someone give me the gist of what exactly he's doing and why? Is he in an actual jail? Is a studio jail? What is the story?

Here is a video clip which appears to be a Livestream of the "jail" he's in- https://x.com/domainsdomain/status/1718414998454566966?t=10hOpIfVLChBL6X2mIZchw&amp;s=09
