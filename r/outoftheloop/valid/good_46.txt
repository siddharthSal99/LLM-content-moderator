Title: What's up with James Harden? 
Post Text: I keep seeing drama around James Harden and the 76ers, including this headline: https://hoopshype.com/2023/10/23/paul-pierce-on-james-harden-i-can-see-this-being-his-last-year-in-the-league/

I don't follow NBA news too closely but know generally how he is supposed to be really good, but has never had much success with his teams. Why is that generally and what's happening this time around?
