Title: What’s the deal with the PM user association? 
Post Text: Correct me if I’m wrong but I thought the limbus company controversy i while back was about a group of people getting mad about a character in a swimsuit not being sexy enough and getting the illustrator fired for it

https://www.gamerbraves.com/limbus-company-illustrator-fired-for-feminist-swimsuit-design-she-didnt-create/

 but now I hear about this group 

https://pmlimbusprotest.city/en.html

that sent a statement to the developers of “guardian tales” sending a complaint about a costume contest in late September , I look over at both games subreddit and they seems to be mocked and I don’t know why
