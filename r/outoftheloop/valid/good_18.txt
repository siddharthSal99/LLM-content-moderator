Title: What’s going on with Mr. Beast and Rosanna Pansino? 
Post Text: Im a little confused on the whole situation honestly. From what I've seen online so far Rosanna Pansino is trying to expose Mr Beast for faking a video where she is claiming she placed in Top 3 of a YouTuber Hide-n-Seek video. I dont think its a big deal since a lot of Youtubers fix a narrative to their videos. Just look at any FaZe Rug video. It’s not like she actually won the game. Am I missing something? Is there more to it? Why is she trying to expose something that happened a year ago? I mean, there has to be more to it, right?

Here is a link to the YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/00NgUctWoLQ?si=FgSwBgP-ULrvloIO
