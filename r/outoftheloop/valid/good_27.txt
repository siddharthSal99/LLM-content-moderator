Title: What is up with Dream getting so much hate? 
Post Text: Haven't been active in any of the mc happenings in almost a year but I suddenly checked back in to see all of Dream's recent instagram post comments completely dissing him (people saying he is ugly, can't sing and is a groomer). I read that there have been allegations a while back but some screenshots got out about the alleged victims faking the whole thing but I am also not sure how valid these screenshots or even the original allegations are. Some of the hate is also due to his singing but I also can't tell why because it sees to have started from a tribute song to Techno. Is this some clout-chasing that people are mad about, the allegations, or something else?
