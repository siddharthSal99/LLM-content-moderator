Rule 0) Explain the reasoning behind your view, not just what that view is (500+ characters required).   [See the wiki for more information](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_a)

Rule 1) You must personally hold the view and demonstrate that you are open to it changing. A post cannot be on behalf of others, playing devil's advocate, as any entity other than yourself, or 'soapboxing'. Posts by throwaway accounts must be approved through modmail.  [See the wiki for more information](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_b)

Rule 2) Submission titles must adequately sum up your view and include "CMV:" at the beginning. 
Posts with misleading/overly-simplistic titles or titles that contain spoilers may be removed.  [See the wiki for more information](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_c)

Rule 3) Posts cannot express a neutral stance, a stance regarding transgender topics, suggest harm against a specific person, be self-promotional, or discuss this subreddit (visit r/ideasforcmv instead). [See the wiki for more information](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_d)

Rule 4) Only post if you are willing to have a conversation with those who reply to you, and are available to do so within 3 hours after posting. 
If you haven't replied during this time, your post will be removed.  [See the wiki for more information](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_e)

Rule 5) Direct responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OP’s stated view (however minor), unless they are asking a clarifying question.   [See the wiki for more information](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_1)

Rule 6) Don't be rude or hostile to other users.  Your comment will be removed even if the rest of it is solid. 'They started it' is not an excuse. You should report it, not respond to it.  [See the wiki for more information](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_2)

Rule 7) Refrain from accusing OP or anyone else of being unwilling to change their view, or of arguing in bad faith. If you are unsure whether someone is genuine, ask clarifying questions (see: socratic method). If you think they are still exhibiting ill behaviour, please message us.  [See the wiki for more information](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_3)

Rule 8) Award a delta if you've acknowledged a change in your view. Do not use deltas for any other purpose. You must include an explanation of the change along with the delta so we know it's genuine. Delta abuse includes sarcastic deltas, joke deltas, super-upvote deltas, etc.  [See the wiki for more information](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_4)

Rule 9) Comments must contribute meaningfully to the conversation. Comments that are only links, jokes, or "written upvotes" will be removed. Humor and affirmations of agreement can be contained within more substantial comments.  Comments on transgender are prohibited.
