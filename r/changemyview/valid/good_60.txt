Title: CMV: The United States should use hundreds of nuclear weapons to create a canal connecting Saudi Arabia to the Indian Ocean through Yemen. 
Post Text: To clarify, this canal would be 1000 feet wide, the entire canal would be at sea level (so no locks needed), and it would go straight from Al Kharkhir (in Saudi Arabia) to Jadib (in Yemen). I assume that the governments of Yemen and Saudi Arabia would both be willing to sign off on the plan given the area is a giant, unoccupied desert and both governments stand to benefit significantly. 

This would solve two big problems:

Problem #1: 
Saudi Arabia’s ability to send oil and gas outside itself would be almost completely shut off if Iran decided to disallow shipping through the Straight of Hormuz. This would cause massive instability. A canal through Yemen (and a giant oil/gas terminal and pipelines at Al Kharkhir) would completely remove this leverage and help ensure the stability of the World’s energy supply and that of Saudi Arabia, which has been a significant stabilizing force in the middle east (although not the most ethical).

Problem #2: 
There is a giant civil war going on in Yemen right now between the Houthis, and the internationally recognized government of Yemen. This civil war has caused a lot of suffering, and one of the main factors enabling it’s continuance is an external supply of weapons to the Houthis that is being sent to them both overland through Oman and by sea. The supply of sea weapons could easily be cut off if the US decided to impose a naval blockade against the parts of Northern Yemen where the Houthis are, and this giant canal would prevent overland supply if it was patrolled with naval boats (also easy). By cutting the supply of weapons to the Houthis, the Yemeni civil war would likely end after a certain period of time due to the Houthis running out of weapons, which would significantly improve the humanitarian situation in the country, weaken Iran (and further disable the ability of it’s proxies to spread religious extremism, harm to civilians and authoritarianism), and further increase the amount of stability in that region of the world, which would significantly benefit from that. 

The costs of this plan would be relatively minimal given that:
A) Very few people are there, nor are there any resources that would be damaged via the detonation of a large number of nuclear weapons. 
B) The US has way too many nuclear weapons to begin with, and this would be a more productive way of disposing them.
