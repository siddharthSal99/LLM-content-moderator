Title: CMV: Glue traps are my best option for a persistent mouse problem. 
Post Text: For context, I live on the first floor of an apartment complex, as in my front door opens directly outside. The area is hilly so some walls of the apartment are actually underground, making me prime territory for pests to target. All food has always been sealed and out of reach, and we keep the place pretty clean.

Many months ago, my roommate and I found our first mouse. The first instinct was to set out non-kill traps and place cayenne pepper (among other household products which are claimed to repel mice) around entrances. These non-kill traps are still out to this day and they have never caught a single thing. (The same was true back in college when I tried to use a non-kill trap to catch a mouse in my dorm.) The bugger(s) tormented us for months, startling us, leaving droppings, even keeping us up late at night trying to trap them after they made their way into a bedroom.

Next, we tried snap traps, which never worked a single time. The mice would eat the food directly off of them and disappear again. I have an allergy to both cats and peanut butter, so getting a “mouser” and things like the “bucket method” were out of the question as well.

Finally, we moved to the last resort of glue traps, despite seeing all over the internet that some people consider them inhumane. The result? We’ve caught something like nine mice to date and I’ve never seen one running around free. Placed along baseboards and in front of entrances, the glue traps seem to catch every mouse that dares enter my home.

Every so often, a mouse gets caught on a glue trap overnight, I wake up in the morning a few hours later to see it, and the trap and mouse both get placed into a plastic grocery bag. Then we take it outside and use a large rock (ooga booga) to flatten it, making sure to crush the cranium in one blow so it’s an instantaneous death.

I understand there is probably some distress, and in some instances even pain, for the few hours between getting caught and getting smushed, but the death is quick and painless. Based on my experience with every other method’s ineffectiveness, it seems like the choice is between this or simply living with a mouse infestation.

I could change my view if someone convincingly proves that there is a better method of dealing with mice, that there’s no tradeoff whereby any level of rodent distress is tolerable, that living with mice is acceptable, or something else I haven’t even thought of!
