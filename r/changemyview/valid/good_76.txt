Title: CMV: The oppressor/oppressed framing that some Progressives use is counterproductive 
Post Text: This is true for progressives I've met in real life and for progressives online. In my experience, many adhere to a strict worldview where one group is the oppressor and one group is the oppressed. 

It's not that I disagree with the idea that some groups as a whole have more power and influence than other groups. I absolutely do, and I don't think this should be the case. I just don't think this information is remotely useful when it comes to policy. Because the problem you run into is while the group *collectively* has more power, most *individuals* lack any sort of meaningful power. 

So when a policy is proposed that disempowers the oppressor group the individuals at the top who are actually doing almost all of the oppressing are not affected, but rather the people at the bottom who are already lacking power to oppress anybody. So basically people who were already powerless to change anything are losing power they cannot afford to lose. That hardly seems like something to celebrate. Change my view.

UPDATE: Aspects of my view and sub views have changed, but I also feel like I should add something else. 

In my original view I talked about how white people cannot afford to lose the limited power they have. Two things: first, I don't mean power *over* other groups I mean just day to day ability to survive. 

Second, that is true, but I'm missing an important piece. It's not just that they can't afford to lose power it's that they need *more* (again, now power over.) They need a boost. Reparations are an example of something that would boost one group, but not all. I still think the money would come from government aid programs and hurt all races that rely on those programs and don't benefit from reparations, but even if that's not true, reparations would be giving to one group what every group needs. 

Whether disempowering is the right way to put it, or just "don't give needed power" I think that's a problem.
