Title: CMV: many stand-up comedians are obnoxiously unfunny and plain rude while crowdworking and undertake the whole endeavour as if anyone who doesn't like his/her "joke" is too sensitive and insecured to be in a comedy club . 
Post Text: Of course it's true that there should be courtesy towards a performer on stage and some people are terrible taking  jokes but at the same time  jokes require certain amount of rhetorical competence to convey fun through joke-structure (and delivery)and not just trashing someone and cursing  like roadside punks at whatever an audience member tells .I am not talking about hecklers who perturb the comedy show by interrupting and interfering the comedian but what happens when during crowdworking an audience member is asked something and she or he normally  replies . This is super unfunny to me at least .
