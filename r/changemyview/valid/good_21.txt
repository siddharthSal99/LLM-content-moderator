Title: CMV: Lots of gun control advocates live in a bubble and assume the worst in gun owners. Most gun owners are not evil and care a lot about the dead kids 
Post Text: Ik this is going to be a controversial topic for many, but looking at what gun control advocates say about gun owners (by in large) vs what gun owners say about gun control advocates it makes perfect sense why so many of them live in this bubble. Most gun owners don't think gun control advocates are evil, yet gun control advocates do not have that mindset. 

It's extremely understandable why so many of them are so hostile and hateful, how could you not be if all you here are mainstream media talking points that the NRA has extreme influence, and that gun owners are the reason for dead kids.
