Title: CMV: We are living in a golden age of music 
Post Text: I’ve seen some posts recently both in this sub and in r/LetsTalkMusic where people complain about contemporary music being dumbed down and bad; about how musicianship and songwriting are no longer appreciated; about how X artist’s popularity is merely manufactured and reflects a dying culture; and so on.

 

These posts are invariably made by people who just don’t actually listen to enough music. 

 

**My CMV statement: we are living in a golden age of music and there is plenty of music out there to serve the tastes of literally any person.**

 

Usually when people complain about the state of music, they are actually just complaining about how the trends in mainstream pop don’t appeal to them.  To some people, listening to music should be a very social experience and it sucks to think that nobody is listening to the music that most appeals to you – this is totally valid.  But what people don’t understand is that the popularity dynamics of music have changed drastically. 

 

It used to be the case that the mainstream was very important, because the options outside the mainstream were so limited.  You could still get into indie music, but it was a very isolating experience.  But what people don’t understand is that what used to be a massive gulf between the mainstream and indie is now very narrow.  It’s almost more like we now have three tiers instead of two: the mainstream, an indie “middlestream,” and an underground of amateur music.  This “middlestream” has formed out of a combination of streaming, social media, music festival culture, and also the current golden age of streaming-television we are also experiencing.  Indie artists that would have been ignored 20 years ago now are able to maintain decent-sized dedicated fanbases which allow them to steadily produce crafted, highly original and unique music.

 

I also think it’s the case that the deficiency of the mainstream is overstated.  People complain about the popularity of Taylor Swift or Bad Bunny as if they make bad music, but these complaints rarely contain any substantial criticism and they usually can be reduced to “this wasn’t made for me so it’s bad.”  This is especially true with the trend of young men trashing Taylor Swift – like, what the hell are they thinking?  Of course they don’t like Swift, her music is written for young women!  But in any case, the criticisms of the mainstream can always be precluded by the simple directive: go listen to other music, it’s out there waiting for you and it was made to appeal specifically to you.
