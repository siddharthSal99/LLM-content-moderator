Title: CMV: my childhood was so bizarre/unconventional, that I should feel extremely embarrased. 
Post Text: So... I am on the Autism Spectrum and naturally that comes with a series of interesting habits. When I was very young i garnered two scars on my left cheek (in separate circumstances, one was because I fell of my bike and another because a cat scratched my face. However, I also have some strange 'masochistic' behaviours whereby I enjoy some degree of physical pain. As a result, I have some depigmentation marks/white lines on my bottom lip, thanks to a period when I was around 12/13, when all I did was sink my nails into it. I have to restrain myself from doing it as of right now, because I know it feels VERY satisfying. Of course, I was a child I was accompanied by a host of other bizarre habits, such as flapping my hands, feeling immensely discomforted by 'small' pictures if I was eating, finding eating with the family around the table to be an immensely stressful procedure, constant bouts of sensory overload. I can't understand how I would inflict this damage upon my face, when I already possessed some scars..... I know of seldom anyone on the Autism Spectrum who has a similar story to my own....
