Title: cmv: Rich people [not all but most] have it good / virtually live perfect lives 
Post Text: Hi,  
  
I'm not saying all but most (90%) of rich people have it good and live perfect lives. People that mostly have millions of dollars live perfect lives. There are those who either get on drugs because of boredom but IMO/V/E they still live perfect lives \[nirvana type\]. If I could have I wish I was aborted. Not having money IMO is hell on Earth. Please tell me how most people who have big houses material things etc... don't live in heaven on Earth. If I were a politician I would make a law saying that two parents would have to make a certain amount of money before birthing biological children. Change my view.
