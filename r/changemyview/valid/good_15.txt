Title: cmv: the Pro-Palestine cause would be stronger if individuals who were Pro-Palestine would explicitly condemn Hamas 
Post Text: Pro-Palestine efforts are shooting themselves in the foot by not condemning Hamas. It's making the movement come off as ideological instead of rational as well as ambivalent to human suffering, not unlike the ways in which Israel has been ideological and ambivalent to the suffering of Palestinians. I think, to most people, the very true fact that Israel's treatment of Palestine *explains* the situation is simply not enough to *justify* the deaths of civilians, and that disconnect is hurting the reputation of the free Palestine movement. Hamas has damaged the reputation of Palestine by targeting civilians, and supporters of a free Palestine would rally far more support if they'd communicate, directly and without concession, the fact that the actions of Hamas were morally reprehensible, without concluding that they were "necessary" or, in so many words, that "Israel had it coming." Unless the majority of Pro-Palestine individuals *are* indeed Pro-Hamas (which I don't want to just assume flippantly because I have no way of knowing whether or not that's true) I don't understand why more people don't condemn Hamas explicitly instead of responding to the attack on Gaza with Pro-Palestine sentiments. At least in the United States, I feel as though the free Palestine movement would retain much more support if they were more explicit in their condemnation of the killings of civilians by Hamas.
