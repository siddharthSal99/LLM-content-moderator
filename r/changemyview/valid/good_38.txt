Title: CMV: Rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD) is not a valid disorder 
Post Text: It has been proposed by a well known clinician that ADHD may be associated with a new disorder known as Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria. According to Dodson, people with ADHD are more likely to develop this other disorder, which is characterised by:

&gt;an extreme emotional sensitivity and pain triggered by the perception that a person has been rejected or criticized by important people in their life. It may also be triggered by a sense of falling shortâ€”failing to meet their own high standards or others' [\[1\]](https://www.additudemag.com/rejection-sensitive-dysphoria-and-adhd/)

I consider RSD unnecessary to account for the strong emotional reactions people with ADHD may have to social rejection or other provocative events like failure to meet goals. It is not a valid disorder with empirical basis in the scientific literature. The problems it includes are already better accounted for by the fact that ADHD involves poor executive functioning and one important such function is emotional self-regulation. That component already explains the high likelihood of executive dysfunction occasioning strong emotional reactions to numerous events than does RSD.

Emotional regulation, in essence,  refers to a variety of steps in the ability to handle emotion:

\- inhibiting inappropriate behaviour related to strong positive or negative emotions that are being elicited by environmental events (response suppression)  
\- engaging in self-directed behaviours to soothe and down  
\- regulate physiological arousal as a result of these emotionally provocative events  
\- refocusing attention away from emotional triggers cognitively and/or physically  
\- organise emotions for coordinated action in the service of goals and long-term welfare  
\- inducing positive, more acceptable mood states (i.e., cognitive reappraisal, proactive situation selection/modification)

Given that people with ADHD have problems with emotional self-control plus inhibition, we'd expect to see a number of issues, not the least of which include highly impulsive emotions, low frustration tolerance, impatience, quickness to anger, heightened emotional excitability and reactivity, and unfiltered emotional expression.

It's easy to see why people with ADHD would be viewed as more emotional, particularly in response to social rejection or to the failure to meet or attend to circumstantial expectations. We don't need RSD to explain that - we already have this part of ADHD - and more broadly, executive functioning, a well accepted aspect of ADHD with substantial research behind it to show this explains those kind of reactions. There's no need for us to introduce another disorder to account for this.

The diagnosis of RSD might lead to individuals being treated inappropriately for this additional apparent mood disorder when in fact, their emotional problems are accounted for by ADHD and can be managed through appropriate forms of licensed treatments such as the ADHD approved medications or CBT.

Moreover, what RSD is doing is assigning each little potential emotional provocation and turning it into a disorder. If I experience road rage and have ADHD, are we now going to have road rage syndrome? Or if I lock my car keys in my car as one adult weightlifter with ADHD did and then proceeded to tear the door off the car to retrieve it, does said individual have automobile rejection sensitivity disorder? You see how ridiculous this gets? Whereas we already have one broad concept accounting for each specific context that the symptom of poor emotional regulation shows up.
