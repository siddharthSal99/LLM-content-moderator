Title: CMV: I am guilt-riddled for killing rats/mice 
Post Text: Hey all. Hoping you can help me change my view: I have a rat and mouse issue in my home. Chewed holes thru the drywall behind the fridge and behind the washing machine. Absolutely. Disgusting. Acted swiftly: trapped 3 mice and 3 rats so far between inside and outside - 3 with humane traps and 3 with snap traps. 1 died in the humane trap before I got to release it -- oof.

I am well versed that there are dozens of serious reasons they must be terminated --  but son of a bitch, I feel terrible for killing them. My mind is consumed with the fact that I've inflicted pain on these creatures for being themselves. They don't know any better. 

I'm sure this is a natural human reaction, and im self aware that i am more sensitive than most. My question - how do I turn it off? How do I justify this to myself when facts don't outweigh the emotion?
