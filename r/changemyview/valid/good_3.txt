Title: CMV: Nuclear power and hydrogen are the only viable alternatives to fossil fuels. The reason they're not being developed more is because of propaganda from fossil fuel companies. 
Post Text: Edit: I have been convinced that renewables should have an equal place alongside nuclear.

Wind power just doesn't generate enough electricity in most places. Solar power is great but it requires a lot of land and also requires the use of massive batteries for energy storage. Hydro-electric power is also great but it's only viable in some places and it can be environmentally destructive. Batteries are a stupid form of large scale energy storage due to the cost of production, limited lifespan, and reliance on rare minerals among other problems.

Build a bunch of big ass nuclear power plants and use their excess power production to split hydrogen from water. Power the grid with the nuclear power plants and use hydrogen for power in cars, trucks, or in other places that you can't put a big ass nuclear power plant. Climate change solved.
