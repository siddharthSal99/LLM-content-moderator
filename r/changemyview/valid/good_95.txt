Title: CMV: No one should support Palestine 
Post Text: There's quite a bit of posts about the conflict but if you're here then you're interested!

Quick note: I am not saying we should not support PalestiNIANS (the people), what they're going through is a horrendous nightmare

Anyway, I want to quickly say what I think I know so that if I'm mistaken it can be pointed out:

- Israel took over most of the surrounding land including what some argue rightfully belong to Palestine, and that this was a long time ago
- This conflict has lasted years and several battles, with the current one being yet another fight for Palestine to take their land back
- However, Israel has tried around 5 times to come to a peaceful agreement (involving the UN at some point) about these lands which have been rejected by Palestine every time
- Lastly, the initiators of today's conflict are literal terrorists

Ok and this is why I hold my view:

- First of all, Palestine begun this conflict (again). Why is anyone supporting the perpetrator of a war that has already caused so much destruction and murder of innocent people
- Also, these were TERRORISTS!!! There's a group in my home country that are similar to Hamas, and if they ever pulled something like this I would never support my country... yet so many support this.
- Israel has had this land for a decently long time, why is Palestine still fighting for it? They're clearly militarily inferior and can't protect it, they should be taking a peace treaty at all costs
- I understand the implications of the land being controlled by Israel (Economic troubles and such) but does this really justify the killing of thousands of innocent people?
- Lastly, it seems Israel is launching a counterattack that to me seems to be fair, they keep getting attacked for the same thing so it's time to shut off Hamas for good. Hamas uses civilians to protect itself while Israel seems to just want to protect its people whatever the cost.

I understand that because of the recent border blockage many Palestenians do not have access to food which is very unjust and horrible to the innocent people, but this has been a common tactic to pressure governments to stop attacks and converse diplomatically or surrender.

That is all, I'm very open to having my view changed on this matter if I'm persuaded. And just in case this is brought up; I am not from either of these countries or their surrounding areas, and I'm also not originally from any of the countries are actively supporting either side, I hold this view purely out of the information I have provided.
