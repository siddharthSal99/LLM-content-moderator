Title: CMV: As a black man in America, I'm tired of society and media making me feel "special" because of something I can't control such as my race 
Post Text: Now personally , I like a lot of black media, like African American actors, artists, and filmmakers.

But at the same time I wish for everyone to be equal in the sense that we all value each other  for our talents, abilities, actions and what we can control about ourselves MORESO than our social identities that we can't control 

Like for example, I'm an artist. Art is my passion. 

And while I can't control how people react to my passion, I personally wouldn't like people saying "he's one of the black artists that shows an example in the black community by doing XYZ"

Because it turns my passion and creativity into a social/political conversation just because of my race. Instead of just seeing me as an artist


I know what I'm claiming is too much to ask for. Since due to our history, experiences, marginalization, and culture we have to "stand up for our black king and queens"

But I rather just stand up for our kings and queens, no matter our race, gender, sexuality, etc.

And before you claim that I'm "All Lives Matter and not Black Lives Matter" No, I'm not. I'm just expressing my feelings of those who have to add the fact that I'm black to any passion or talent that I have. Instead of just seeing me for me
