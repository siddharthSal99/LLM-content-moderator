Title: CMV: Labelling your political beliefs is backwards and counter-productive 
Post Text: There's days it seems like everyone feels the need to label everything they believe in. 

E.G. "I'm Pro-this" "I'm anti-this" or "I side with such and such".

On top of that, people will call themselves liberal or conservative, or Republican or Democrat.

Not only is this an incredibly childish and simplistic way to go about politics, but it's entirely counter-productive. 

Grouping yourself into boxes and labels prevents you from being able to think critically and deeply about your beliefs. It's easier to just give yourself a label and let other people do the thinking for you. 

And on top of that, for example, if you call yourself a Vesselite (made up name), and proudly go against the Orderlites, then it makes it really hard for our natural egos to accept when your party does stupid things or does things that go against your normal moral values. This allows corrupt politicians to get away with doing shitty things because people in their party won't dare condem them because it would allow their "enemy" to have a leg up on them. 

This also leads to political wars, whether it be psychological wars or actual wars because no matter how wrong their own side is (that they've backed themselves into), they will still stand by them because they've already declared to the world that they are "such and such" and backing out of that would mean exposing their ego and admitting they are wrong, to which, most people would rather die on their hill than just admit they are wrong or just not plant themselves on a hill to begin with. 

Just approach each situation individually and condem and praise actions individually. Vote in silence and stop declaring yourself to the world for everything. But it's too easy to bunch up into groups with the internet.
