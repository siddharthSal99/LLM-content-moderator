Title: CMV: In Western nations, the talk of "persecution" and "falling away/End Times" is usually an excuse by Christians to avoid confronting their own failures or shortcomings as a religion. 
Post Text: First off, I don't deny that Christians are persecuted in **non**\-Western nations. If someone wants to point to Christians who are imprisoned or persecuted in North Korea, China, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, etc., you'll get no disagreement from me.

What I see in the West, however, is that Christians will talk about "persecution" any time they face consequences for behaving like a jerk or a hypocrite, and they will talk about a "falling away because the End Times are near" any time they face consequences for bad parenting or bad pastoring.

Persecution first = there's a huge difference between being persecuted because you are a good upright Christian and an evil society hates you, and being rightfully criticized because you are a hypocrite, or try to impose your religion on other people, or you're promoting something that's historically or factually inaccurate. But many western Christians try to pretend that the latter is the former.

The same is true of the "falling away" that Christians speak of - that as the End Times draw near, the world will become less and less Christian. They often point to the declining numbers of Christian attendance at church, Christian affiliation in Europe and America, to prove this point. But this argument makes it sound as if bad Christian teaching (prosperity gospel, false prophecies, bad theology, wrong teaching, hypocrisy) had nothing to do with it, when in fact I'd argue that it's the **leading** cause of it. The main reason for the decline of Christianity in the West is not so much that the West is out to get Christians, as it is that people increasingly demand scientific and historical proof and evidence and are not willing to just go by blind faith, and also that a heavy dose of Trumpism, Christian hypocrisy, prosperity gospel-ing has taken an immense toll and driven many people away from Christianity.

TL;DR; Christians think they are being persecuted, but in fact much of it is just them encountering the simple logical consequences of bad religion.
