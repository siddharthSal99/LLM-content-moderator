Title: CMV: Stalin behaved in a very brave way during the battle of Moscow 
Post Text: Just a quick disclaimer: I'm not a fan of bloodthirsty dictators, especially the ones from the 20th century, so this post is in no a way a generic appreciation for Stain. I also should add that I'm not an historian. 

Anyway here we go:

I've always considered 20th century dictators are murderous self-serving narcissistic psychopath but last night I watched this WW2 documentary and it said that Stalin was taken to the train station and was ready to board his special train to be evacuated to the east when he took the historical decision to stay in Moscow. For readers not too familiar with the situation at the time:

* German troops were just 10-12 miles from Moscow;
* German troops had been smashing trough Russian defenses or months conquering hundreds of miles. 
* German Luftwaffe had already shown the world its capacity to obliterate entire cities with carpet bombing. 

The probability that German troops would take Moscow were extremely high and Stalin knew well what would happen to him once captured, being shot immediately probably the best he could hope for. 

This was not some Adolf Hitler "end of days" situation: Hitler had nowhere to escape, I don't see anything brave in Hitler killing himself in his bunker while surrounded. Stalin had thousands of miles of safe territory to the east where he could continue to direct the war effort, his risky decision to stay put was a way to lead by example.
