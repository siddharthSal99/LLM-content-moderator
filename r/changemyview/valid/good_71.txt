Title: CMV: We should have a National No Tipping Day 
Post Text: Let's face it: the tipping culture in the US is absolutely out of control. Everyone around Reddit keeps complaining about it. Instead of just constantly moaning on and on, I propose a solution: we have a no tipping day on December 15th.

Tipping culture is absolutely nuts. Since 2018, inflation went up by 22.51% whilst the 'standard' minimum tipping percentage went from 12% to 18%. Default options went from 12-15-18 to 18-21-25. That means that a $100 meal with a $12 tip in 2018 is now a $122.51 meal with a $22.05 tip, a \~2x increase in tip within the last half decade.

And before you corporate drones complain "OHHH HJUST DONT EAT OUT IF YOU CANT TIP", you're part of the problem! People all around the world work for only their salary PAID BY THEIR EMPLOYERS. Why is it that the service industry is the only one where customers must give extra so that the employees to \*do their job correctly\*? This isn't even mentioning the iPads spinning around for the employee to hand over a drink or even tipping at a self checkout.

The sense of entitlement these days is insane. I used to deliver UberEats using a skateboard and saw and appreciated ANY tip as a bonus. But now, service workers are complaining over a $5 tip on a $20 pizza. Why the hell does a waitress deserve a tip for carry plates of food over but our sanitation workers don't for smelling literal shit all day and carry huge, heavy trash cans? And before you say "OHHH WAITRESSES GET PAID LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE THEY NEED TIPS TO SURVIVE", this is ONLY the case because of the tipping culture. We should demand the businesses to pay their employees properly rather than stick our heads in the sand. P.S. did you know that many service workers, especially at the fancier places, could clear more than engineers and nurses on tips alone?

Now keep in mind, I'm not saying we should never tip. I'm happy to buy the people working on my roof a few packs of beer or give exceptional workers money to show appreciation. What I'm saying is 'tipping' should not be the norm simply for someone doing the bare minimum of their job requirements.

Again, let's stop pretending that nothing could be done about this problem. On December 15th, let's have a no tipping day as the first step.
