Title: CMV: Fines should entirely scale with income 
Post Text: Fines are not a fair punishment and equality is lost on them. A poor person faces a harsher punishment than a well off person. Fines already scale with income, yes. But there is a cap. E.g speeding fines are capped at £1,000 (£2,500 if it's on a motorway). A doctor paying a £1,000 speeding fine when he earns 58k per year and an undergraduate paying a £480 speeding fine on an income of £22k a year isn't equal. The higher the income, the less harsh the punishment. There shouldn't be a cap. It should look at your income and make a decision from that.
