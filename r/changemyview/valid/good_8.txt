Title: CMV: religion and traditions shouldn't have such a high regard as it has. 
Post Text: I do not believe that traditional values are important these days, religion even less. Some people may argue that religion enforces morale onto people but I think that doesn't have to be the case, as I've been raised with minimal acknowledge of religion.

In my humble opinion, both of the mentioned values put people away from progression, force a role mindset on a certain group of people, control them, or create a cult that becomes extreme over time leading to later problems that alienate people from people with different beliefs.

Edit: while speaking of religion, I have in mind the major ones (Islam and Christianity)
Also "traditions" refer to the enforcement of roles
