Title: CMV: men should offer women their number instead of asking them for theirs. 
Post Text: So in our current society we have a few gender norms that are pretty dumb and downright destructive. One of those is that men are supposed to chase and be active while dating. Women on the otherhand are reactive. Pretty much everyone would benefit if we got rid of this dynamic. 

A common issue men face is that women often times give out their number when asked, even if they aren’t actually interested. That means they either never text back or they only text back to be polite. And men are often seen as overly aggressive if they keep texting. 

So here’s my solution; When you approach a woman and want to get to know her, don’t ask her for her number. Offer her your own. That way, she has more agency and it avoids weird situations. If she does text, it’s clear that she’s interested. No games. No weird chasing. Should become the norm honestly. 
Its also in line with empowerment for women. Have them decide whether or not they want to keep contact.
