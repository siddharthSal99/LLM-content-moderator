Title: CMV: There's nothing wrong with MLB's new playoff format 
Post Text: For those who aren’t familiar, starting in 2022 the MLB changed their playoff format.  I won’t get into the full history of the playoff format changes, you can check that out here:

But basically, what we have now is a 6-team playoff format where the 2 division winners with the best records are given a bye to the quarter-final round (the “Division Series”), and the division winner with the lowest record plus 3 wild card teams (i.e. teams with the highest records without winning their division) play a “Wild Card Round” of games to secure their place in the Division Series.  The rest of the playoffs precedes as usual.

 

There are some controversies around this format, mostly centered around the concern that teams that were relatively weak during the regular season can sneak in and eliminate much “better” teams.  This was seen as more acceptable when there was only one wild card team – now, there are three.  Critics of the format are pointing to the current playoffs an example of why this is bad: the regular-season juggernaut teams were all eliminated (Braves, Dodgers, Astros, Orioles, Devil Rays), and the Diamondbacks are in the World Series despite only winning 84 games in the regular season. 

 

Basically, the core of my view is that regular season achievement and playoffs achievement are two distinct things that can be appreciated separately, so it doesn’t bother me when a “weaker” team bumps a “stronger” team out of the tournament.  The gap between an 84-win team and a 100-win team is 16 games, or roughly 10% of the season.  The team with the most wins is obviously better, and that’s a massive achievement requiring consistent performances across an entire team.  However, the 100-win team isn’t *that much* better, specifically not the extent that we should ever think that their performance in ~26 playoff games would be a foregone conclusion.

 

In the regular season, we appreciate consistency.  In the playoffs, we appreciate performance.  So much about a single game of baseball is contingent, which is why we track playoff stats separately from regular season stats.  We account for the psychological dimension to the playoffs: the increased competitive pressure leads to unexpected performances.  I think it’s actually a wonderful and exciting thing for a team like the Diamondbacks to succeed in the playoffs, it affirms the importance of determination and tenacity, in addition to skill and talent.  And if the Diamondbacks go all the way, it doesn’t take anything away from the Dodgers’ regular season achievement of winning 100 regular season games and taking the NL West pennant.  The 2023 Dodgers are still objectively the “better” team, they just weren’t better for a 5-game series in October.

 

Another potential problem that people have raised about the current format is that the two teams given byes might “go cold” from having so many off-days before they play again.  I might CMV if someone can convince me that this creates a serious competitive disadvantage, but I am on the fence about it.   In 2023, of the 4 teams given byes only the Astros survived into the next round; but also, of the four teams only the Dodgers seriously underperformed, and I think there are better explanations for why they failed than having extra days off.
