Title: cmv: the left is failing at providing an alternative to outrage culture from the right 
Post Text: This post was inspired by a post on this subreddit where the OP asked reddit to change their view that young men not getting laid isn't inherently political.

I would argue that has been politicized by the likes of Steve Bannon, who despite being an evil sentient diseased liver, is an astute political animal and has figured out how to tap into young men's sexual frustration to bend them rightward.

But that's not what this post is about.

Please change my view that the left, the constellation of progressive, egalitarian, and feminist causes has been derelict in providing a counter to the aggrieved victimhood narrative. In fact, i would argue that the left has abandoned the idea that young men CAN be provided with a vision if healthy masculinity.

Edit: well I won't say my view has been totally changed but there were some very helpful comments. 

My big takeaway is that this is a subject being discussed in lefty spaces, but because the left is so big on consensus building, it's difficult for us to feel good about holding up concrete examples of what a "good man" looks like.

In contrast to the right, which tends to have a black and white thinking, it's an easy subject for then to categorically define things like masculinity. Even when they get it wrong. 

The left is really only capable of providing fluid guidelines on this subject and as there are so many competing values, they're not as eager to make those broad assertions.

I still feel like the left MUST do better about finding ways to circumvent the hijacking of young men into inceldom, Tate shit, etc.. but it's a big messy issue. 

To the people who wanted to just say, "boys don't need to be coddled" while saying "the left is more open to letting men be open", I think you need to read what you write before posting it. Feelings don't care about facts. If young men feel they're being left behind, that's a problem.
