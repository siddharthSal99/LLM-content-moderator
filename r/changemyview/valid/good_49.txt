Title: Cmv: “team-building” activities are a waste of time and resources and HR is probably better off using those funds for something else 
Post Text: We are in the middle of two giant projects at work. I’m working 60-70 hour work weeks just to get these two things out of the way.

Today, HR forced us to go to this event and do “team-building” activities with other members of the org. I literally do not have the time and I was still told I couldn’t work today. 

It was just… stupid. Two guys were invited to give us a talk about team work and motivation and attitude. We then went on to play games and write letters to each other. I have learned nothing. I have gained nothing. Just had a few laughs at some points. Ultimately not worth the 10 hours I lost today. 

I don’t hate having fun. I enjoy games. I enjoy my coworkers and overall we have a great job environment. But these people are not my family. I don’t need to know them on a personal level. They don’t HAVE to be my friends. I’m entirely fine just… going to work, doing what I gotta do and leave. Specially when I’m already working 60-70 hour work weeks.

I know this was all organized with good intentions,and it probably took so much effort to put together, but when it comes to team-building…
