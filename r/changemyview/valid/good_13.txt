Title: CMV: International Relations is more politically oriented than Political Science 
Post Text:  Though it may seem contradictory at first, I believe International Relations tends to have more emphasis on controversial topics, while Political Science students tend to just stray into domestic politics and election polls. While the two do deal with politics, someone who says they’re an International Relations I believe might have more politically partisan views, just not in the same way as someone with a major in Political Science would have.

 I understand there are what we can call “neutral topics” in International Relations but it seems to me that those who study it will get a more political perspective than those who study Political Science who are only more political in so far as domestic issues and which candidates are better for this which I give the point to, but when it comes to real world issues I think IR majors are more likely to be political it’s just the general public might not think of it that way.
