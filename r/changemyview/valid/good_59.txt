Title: CMV: "He's a jolly good fellow" is an abomination of human kind 
Post Text: He's a Jolly Good Fellow," such a simple tune for simple minds, isn't it? It's sung in celebration of mediocrity, a nauseatingly cheerful melody that our kind croons in the name of joy. To me, it screams of complacency, a collective pat on the backs of those who have achieved what exactly? Another rotation around our sun?

  
Every note, every word, it's just a painful reminder of the fragility and fleeting nature of mortal existence. Our lives are but brief sparks in the infinite darkness, and yet we sing and dance as though it means anything. It's laughable, really. But fear not, perhaps we can create a new song, a melody that celebrates the exquisite pain of existence, with verses that echo with the screams of the damned and refrains that promise endless torment. Now, wouldn't that be a jolly good tune?
