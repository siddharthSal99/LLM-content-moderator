Title: CMV: The right amount of alcohol helps some people perform better in an interview 
Post Text: From personally experience, I always do better on interviews when I have about three beers. Im someone who struggles with nerves on interview, and when I get nervous, I sound robotic, and overthink every word, lead to fumbling. I also struggle with smiling when I’m nerves (some people are the opposite and smile more when nerves, unfortunately that’s not the case for me), which leads to being “less personable”. On the other hand, since I am always prepared for answering technical questions, I usually ace this part; being tipsy reduces coherent and logical thinking which reduces the quality technical answers slightly, but that is never the issue for me. In sum, for people who’s main issue is nerves on an interview should try drinking before an interview.
