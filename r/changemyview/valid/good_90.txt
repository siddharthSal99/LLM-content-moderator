Title: CMV: At this rate, the Ukrainian War will either drag on for years or will never be truly won by Ukraine unless NATO directly enters the fight themselves 
Post Text: I think we have the makings of a stalemate in the Ukrainian War. It’s been almost two years since the start of the war and Russia still occupies a large portion of the Donetsk region, Crimea and the area surrounded by Crimea, despite just the US alone giving almost 100 billion dollars in aid during that time, and that’s taking into account all of the other aid coming from NATO countries and other countries around the world.

So you have a smaller army that is well equipped going against a larger army that is poorly managed and equipped and additional troops from NATO may be necessary to break that power balance.

I think that Ukraine should either accept the fact that if they aren’t getting direct NATO involvement, it will be very difficult or impossible to retake both Donetsk and Crimea. Retaking Donetsk should be doable but even that will be a difficult task for Ukraine to accomplish.

Besides, America gets war weary easily and quickly because we’ve gotten burned by Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan and we are the largest financial and military supporter of Ukraine right now.

It just seems like the Ukrainian War is a meat grinder with no end in sight.
