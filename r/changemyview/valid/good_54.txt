Title: CMV: Racial tribalism is bad. 
Post Text: I am Asian American. I am wholly Asian and wholly American, yet I interact with people from various different cultural, religious, ethnic, racial, and national backgrounds on a daily basis. Racial tribalism would be the exact opposite, sticking to one's own racial or cultural group and interacting with people from other racial or cultural groups as minimally as possible, or not at all. As an Asian American, I think my racial group (at least where I live in San Diego) is well integrated with the rest of American society and have friends of many different races or cultural backgrounds. However, it pisses me off that many younger Asian Americans also often defend racial tribalism (which I've witnessed frequently), just because their parents did it despite the fact they don't really engage in racial tribalism themselves. Racial tribalism harms society and us individually, and I'll delve into both here:

Firstly, racial tribalism is a severe impediment to social cohesion. If we try to interact with each other as little as possible, how can we cooperate, innovate, or progress? We become unable to address and fix problems together as a society because of our balkanization. The only way to get shit done is to unite. It also certainly leads to "othering" and stereotypes, which are the first steps towards full blown racism. What is especially hypocritical is that the same Asian Americans who defend racial tribalism also complain when we get stereotyped or people are uneducated about our culture. The Nazis and imperial Japanese were racial tirbalists, though of course at a scale not present today. But of course, they didn't start out at that scale either... We become ignorant of the other side, which is especially said to see as I love engaging with and interacting with different cultures. It is very enriching and you learn a lot.

Additionally, it can inhibit us individually. When we (I don't mean specifically Asians, I mean "we" just as a pronoun) "other" other races, then they will "other" us back. This can negatively impact people emotionally. Also, when we interact with as many people as possible regardless of race, our social networking and opportunities increase as a result.

Of course this isn't to mean people can't want to spend time with people of a similar culture, but they should feel comfortable interacting with a larger multiracial society as a whole. I can understand how many groups such as the Chinese, Blacks, Italians, Irish, Jews, Mexicans, Japanese, Arabs, etc were forced to tribalize in the past (in American history), but now is a different time and America is the greatest melting pot in the world and we should not take it for granted.
