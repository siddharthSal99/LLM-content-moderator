Title: CMV: Reddit's culture of turning every serious topic into jokes, sarcasm, dark humor is an untreated psychological issue. 
Post Text: 1. I have not come across a single post on the whole of reddit where the comments are not at least 50% full of jokes, sarcasm, teasing, references to other subjects, also with lots of upvotes. Which shows that a lot of people support the commentator.  
2. Be it animal abuse, veganism, murder, historical events, drugs, police, and many more sensitive topics, many redditors resort to funny dialogues and puns. I also see lots of people provoking vegans in popular subreddits for emotional reaction, they are like "Lol keep going. Animal yummy". Such replies have upvotes always.  
3. One defense they may use is that humor is a way to release anxiety, stress, nervousness. I know that nervous laughter is a thing, but it is something that happens subconsciously in real life events. How does writing a comment by moving your fingers on a website release your anxiety or stress or nervousness? It seems an excuse to keep going because nobody can rebut such facts.  
4. I don't know why there are so many "stand up comedians" on reddit but it's very annoying. Even that passing joke "I also choose this person's dead wife" is simply tasteless and crass but I don't know why it is so popular on reddit.  
5. Many reddit posts has comments at the bottom with 1 upvote that are just plain sarcasm for no reason. If one confronts them on their humor, they will be like "chill bro".   
6. Humor is not just "social activity" but it embodies a lot of other things such as insensitivity to the topic, belittling the seriousness, refusal to deal with a serious topic, avoidance of emotions and lots of validation seeking. They are often full of lies too.  
7. In conclusion this website is full of people with immature and juvenile tendencies who wouldn't do anything about it because it does not affect their lives in ways they realize. If something gives them upvotes and notifications, they must be doing something good right? Nothing will change because these are not just kids but full adults in 30s 40s and above who have no chance of personality change.  
8. It reminds me of lots of internet celebrities and people who think that they are not a narcissist, when we know for a fact that "those who post on social media are more likely to be narcissist", but does that make any less number of vloggers, influencers, selfies?
