Title: CMV: Most people don't actually want art to be apolitical 
Post Text: Now I am  not saying all art is political but I think all art can be interpreted to be political. You could make a show about say a guy working at a gas station and someone could interpret it as being a metaphor for capitalism. I have become more annoyed about the culture war about movie, tv video games its irritating.



 A lot of things people complain about either are not political (The Mario Movie) or they feature a group of people that really shouldnt be considered political. People keep saying they want escapism and thats fine but with the rise of social media I feel that is almost impossible. Recently the Daily Wire  is trying to create their own snow white and other shows which kind of contradict "apolitical content"


 It seems almost that they are jealous of mainstream media they believe it brainwashes people and they really want the power to do that. It seems like most people want content that reflects there values so I don't see the point in being dishonest about that.
