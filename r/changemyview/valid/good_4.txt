Title: CMV: Trunk or treat is killing the fabric of America 
Post Text: Trunk or treat devalues Halloween and the communal spirit of walking your neighborhood interacting with your neighbors and building community. Trunk or treats are cheap thrills for kids and don’t provide the memories or sense of community that trick or treating night of Halloween provides. With communities offering multiple trunk or treat events before Halloween it diminishes the great tradition oh having that one night a year where everyone collectively dresses up and shares in the tradition of walking the neighborhood and ‘working’ for your candy! Not to mention you can’t tell me that all these trunk or treats are not really the brainchild of nestle to sell more candy that I’m sure of! /rant I’m just sad to see a great thing like Halloween be slowly reduced over time due to competing low effort events that do little to build community at the local level.
