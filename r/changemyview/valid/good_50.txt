Title: CMV: Consistently browsing, sharing, and judging AITA posts are mentally bad for your health 
Post Text: I'm currently going through a self introspection of myself and a relationship I had that ended a few weeks back. One of the things that came to bother me now was that my ex was a frequenter of AITA and AmITheAsshole, and would share posts from there to me, and then calling either the OP, or the person the OP was talking about a psycho, or an asshole, and would do that multiple times in a day. I've never frequented those subreddits before, and I was a bit uncomfortable at first, but then I got into it due to her. Looking back, it felt like this kind of interaction with the subreddit might not necessarily have been healthy mentally for the both of us, since it might have been some sort of coping mechanism to judge and make it seem like her / our life was so much better than theirs. I can't help but think now that this is might not have been healthy at all.
