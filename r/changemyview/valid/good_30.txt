Title: CMV: The Thing from the 1982 Carpenter movie is the scariest monster ever imagined. 
Post Text: First CMV from me, so I start with a light but fun subject, horror in fantasy.

The movie ''The Thing'' of 1982 is a masterpiece and featured what I consider the scariest monster, not only in cinema but in all works of fiction ever written.

Some will say that fear differs for each individual and while it's indeed true there are some phobias that are shared by everyone: fear of death, fear of the unknown, fear of mutilation, fear of betrayal, etc... And that specific monster manages to convey them like no other.

To develop a little more on my thought, here are the 3 domains The Thing manages to excel (warning, does contain some spoilers from the movie):

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Shock value:** Starting with the most obvious, that creature is absolutely disgusting, a blasphemous sight to behold. A mass of flesh, screaming, wiggling, constantly transforming its body part, looking like a twisted and disfigured version of the animals it tries to copy. It is at the pinnacle of body horror, and scarce are the monsters that can come close to that degree of perversion of the flesh. But it's not just horrible to look at, that abomination is extremely dangerous: creating mouthes to bite you, tentacles to bind you, acid spray to melt you and even splitting itself in case of danger. And let's not forget that a single contact with the Thing is enough to infect any living organism, adding them to its entity. Way more terrible than the traditional zombie method of infection. If it manages to reach our civilization it would be the end for humanity as stated in the movie.
2. **Paranoia-inducing:** Of course, it wouldn't stand at the top with just a horrifying appearance. The Thing is smart, in fact much smarter than humanity, being able to construct a spaceship with just scrap in a matter of hours. But it's its sneaky nature that makes it so fearful, like a predator waiting for the right moment to strike its prey.  Usually, in a horror story, the danger comes from the outside, hence when a group of characters are together, the tension falls back because being united makes them stronger against adversity. With the Thing it's the contrary, being able to shapeshift into anyone makes it nearly impossible to detect in a group. We don't know who we can put our trust in and when the creature will strike. Associated with the shock value explained earlier, it's even more uncomfortable to imagine that monstrosity being in the same room as the rest of the characters. And that feeling extends to the very end of the movie, where we don't even know if the creature is one of the two last survivors or not.
3. **Unfathomable threat:** Now the cherry on the cake comes from the mystery surrounding it. We know practically nothing about it. It came from the sky in a spaceship a long time ago, but that's all from its origin. Was it a biological weapon from an alien race? Did it destroy every civilization it came in contact with? Considering it's a shapeshifter copying the life forms it comes across, even its original form stays unknown if it has any. Its total lack of communication with the human character, or the spectator makes it impossible to know his real thoughts. We only know that it wants to assimilate any potential host. That means we can't try to humanize it even a little. I think its name describes perfectly our difficulty in understanding it, it's not an animal, not a robot, not a demon, it's just a Thing. Some might even call it, with reason, ''Lovecraftian'' for its otherworldly nature.

So here is my explanation of why it's the scariest of them all. If I do this CMV it's because the movie The Thing was the very first horror movie I've seen (I did see The Birds by Hitchcock prior but it's clearly not in the same league), and it holds a special place in my heart so I'm might be biased. Secondly, since I didn't watch, read, or play every piece of horror media that ever existed, I might have missed an ever scarier monster. But until then, I stand my ground!
