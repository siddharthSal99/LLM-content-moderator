Title: CMV: People who want lower gas prices in America should not push to increase production, a better strategy would be to eliminate demand. 
Post Text: Gas prices are always a big political talking point in this country, and when it gets any more nuanced than blaming the current person in the White House, people talk about America not producing enough which I think is the wrong way to go about it, even ignoring environmental concerns.

We need to cut down oil consumption domestically. This isn't theoretical, we have a real life example of this during covid, [gasoline consumption fell 40%](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=46141) and gasoline was the cheapest it had been in over a decade even before accounting for inflation. 

Supply is not really an issue, America is a net petroleum exporter, it's not a question of local supply and import costs like Europe. Although those figures are often misleading because there are different types/grades of oil used for different things (diesel or jet fuel, vs gas for example) foreign gasoline that is imported to be refined then exported to a third country, etc, so that figure isn't as cut and dry as it sounds to a layman. But if we want to leverage our large supply of petroleum to have low gas prices, we want to create an environment where O&amp;G are desperate to sell their oil at any price they can get for it, not by tons of people bidding it up.

If we want to decrease Oil prices, we should encourage alternatives that reduce the demand, everybody talks about increasing supply, but OPEC will increase the price of oil as they see fit regardless of what we do, we should limit our exposure to oil. We want only the lowest overhead, most efficient wells to be profitable, there is no cheap gas when it is still economically viable to have offshore wells, and refine low quality oil like Western Canadian Select or other heavy sour crude oils to meet demand.

We should:

* Encourage work from home policies at workplaces around the country.

* Increase the usage of public transportation, increase frequency, encourage dense development in growing cities that make driving not a necessity, not every city will become New York City, but if half the new developments in Atlanta or Austin had the density of Allentown, Pennsylvania and busses every 10 minutes (so that people actually *use them*), it would save a hell of a lot of car trips. Economies of scale inherent to public transportation would mean this would be cheaper for the end user, even considering taxes, than car ownership. Especially since insurance rates are through the roof. There's a reason there are so many influencers and media personalities that talk about living in New York, Chicago, DC, and compared to Houston. Many people like dense, walkable cities, and if we can just give more people who already *want* to live in one the ability to do so, that would save a lot of miles driven. There's a reason NYC has the lowest carbon emissions per capita despite being a place with more billionaires than anywhere else.

* Of course, not everyone can take public transportation, and for those who *are* buying new cars, we should encourage EV adoption, yes some apartments aren't set up, yes, if you drive 500 miles in a day, they won't work, but for most people, it will. This would again decrease oil demand, and thus should decrease prices for those who still use gasoline/diesel vehicles.


Oil is a global market, so if we decrease demand locally, likely a lot would be exported, however, our two neighbors Mexico and Canada, both of whom have pipelines into this country to sell oil, are net oil exporters so that is unlikely to have the effect of replacing domestic demand. We could always export to China or other countries with significantly more local demand than supply, but then we'd be competing on the global market [with over a dozen countries with lower production costs than us,](https://www.statista.com/statistics/597669/cost-breakdown-of-producing-one-barrel-of-oil-in-the-worlds-leading-oil-producing-countries/) but wouldn't they just shut down wells? [Not to the degree you may think, for many oil producers, even if a well is unprofitable, it makes more sense to keep extracting oil because of their fixed costs](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/22/839851865/why-the-world-is-still-pumping-so-much-oil-even-as-demand-drops-away).

If we want to oil oil prices, we should do whatever we can to bring demand down to what it was 3 years ago without affecting the average citizens quality of life. This means creating artificial demand destruction.
