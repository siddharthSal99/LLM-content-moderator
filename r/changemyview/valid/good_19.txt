Title: CMV: Free college in the US would be a disaster without significant additional legislation 
Post Text: To start off, I will say that I 100 percent agree with the idea of college being affordable (or even free) for everyone.

What I think is a bad idea, is leaving all of the various elements of higher education unchanged and then subsidizingtuition. It seems crazy to me to look at how tuition has increased well past inflation, not ask why, and then throw even MORE money to schools.

Universities have to compete with eachother, and have done so by ([according to Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/prestoncooper2/2020/08/31/a-new-study-investigates-why-college-tuition-is-so-expensive/?sh=7e99c48417a0)) overinvesting in amenities and administrative positions. With the relative easy access to student loans, prospective students can "pay" for these higher budgets. The normal free-market consequences to this kind of runaway spending don't apply. Still, there is at least SOME consequence of going into massive amounts of debt, meaning there is still SOME competition based on pricing. Removing this by significantly subsidizing college tuition means that there will be no barrier to Universities continuing to bloat their budgets and raise their tuitions. If the average cost rises to 50K, it will still be accessible to students, because only the goverment will feel the increase. While it's easy to say "well we can just keep raising the tax on billionaires", it's not that simple.

1. The Free College for All Act has a hard income limit for subsidized education. This means middle class families will eventually find it impossible to pay for college.

Bernie Sanders's plan indicates that you get no subsidies if your household income is above 125K single / 250K married. With the rising costs of all other good and services, that amount of money already isn't that high for a single parent. That number supposedly ties to the consumer pricing index, which is flawed for a number of reasons and is laughably out of touch with current numbers. With tuition raises consistently outpacing inflation, and the CPI only weighting arond 2% of its number towards tuition costs, the proposed legislation will not be able to scale according to the actual AFFORDABILITY of college.

2.The Free College for All Act is dependent on a fixed percentage tax on stock trading. This is both inherently risky and difficult to scale with rising costs

The text of the Wall Street Speculation Tax does not provide for an automatic increase in taxes. I don't even know if that's something that can really happen. One assumes that this is based on the correlative increase in money moving around the market as other costs (tuition) rise. The problem is that it doesn't account for periods of stagnation or recession. Counting on the stock market growing on as short-term of a basis as this is a really bad idea. Even if you could somehow tie the stock market to a certain guaranteed growth, tuition prices have grown at a considerably larger rate. Not doing anything about the exponential increase means that eventually, you're going to need to raise the rate of the tax. If you're dealing with a Republican congress, you're fucked.

3. Vocational training will be shortchanged even more.

Removing the financial component from colleges will make them more desirable. Many people take vocational paths for financial reasons. Of course, this is the point of free college. You're removing an unfair barrier like finances to make college acceptance based purely on merit. That's all well and good until schools expand their capacities. If, say 15,000 students are elgible for acceptance and can currently afford college, what happens if 30,000 students are now eligible for acceptance and can afford it? Do they make that school 50% harder to get into, or do they PRINT MONEY by expanding their capacity?

&amp;#x200B;

4. Schools will be harder for low-income students to get into.

Take the above point. Colleges can only increase their supply so much to deal with an explosion in demand due to free college. They will have to become more exclusive. Lower income students have a harder time being competitive with things like test scores, grades, and extracurriculars. Free college does nothing to actually change that. The outcome will likely not be a significant demographic change in college admissions. Eventually, progressive admissions standards will be pushed more aggressively to unpredictable results.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, the only way free college will work is with significantly more government oversight into the inner-workings of universities. Tuitions would need to be standardized and set by the government, and increases would need to happen with government approval. University budgets would need to be gone over with a fine-toothed comb. Capacity limits, both university wide and for individual programs, would have to be laid against the availability of JOBS and not left up to the institution. Student amenities would need to make sense, and not be used as a competitive edge for schools. Free college for all is a great idea, but without those caveats it would be a disaster.
