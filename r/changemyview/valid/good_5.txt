Title: CMV: Socialism and Capitalism are much less important than democracy and checks on power 
Post Text: There is no pure Socialism or pure Capitalism anyway.  Neither can exist practically in a pure form. It's just a spectrum. There have to be some things run by the state and some kind of regulated free market. Finding the right balance is mainly a pragmatic exercise.  The important items that seem to always get conflated into Socialism and Capitalism are checks on power and free and democratic elections. Without strong institutions in these two aspects, the state will soon lapse into dictatorships, authoritarianism and/or totalitarianism. I'm not an expert in either of these areas, so I'm happy to enlightened here, but these Capitalism vs Socialism arguments always seem strange to me. Proponents on both sides always seem to feel like the other system is inherently evil when it seems obvious that there has to be some kind of hybrid model between the two. Having a working government that can monitor the economy and tweak this balance is much more important than labeling the system in my opinion.

Edit: There are far more interesting responses here than I can process quickly. It may take me the better part of a week to go through them all with the thoughtfulness they deserve. Thanks for all the insightful comments. This definitely has the potential to further develop my perspective on these topics. It already has me asking some questions.
