Title: CMV: Neither the current politics of Israel nor Palestine are anything to be backed, and the issue is more a wholesale one 
Post Text: I have been trying to work out my opinion on this for a while now. I don’t think either side here is ‘right,’ I think the war just needs to be *stopped*. All in all, I currently think backing one particular side is missing the point and that general humanitarian aid is necessary, and while that’s necessary in all conflicts, I think that both sides have flawed views of the other.

Here’s my more general views of each:

**Palestine**
- Generally supports Hamas who have killed many innocents
- Likely hasn’t done all the terrible things media says they have, but they’ve certainly done some of it.
- Has a right to their own land and history

**Israel**
- Has actively been aggressively colonizing Palestinian Land
- Has been violently expansionist in the past
- Has a right to live here in peace and to their history

I think my opinion about how people approach the issue is convoluted… but I’d like for you to change my view.
