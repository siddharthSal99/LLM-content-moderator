Title: CMV: Sexual Jealousy is often a sign of unkindness towards the person you like 
Post Text: So lets say that Katie is sexually jealous that Mark slept with Anna.  
  
I think this often involves Katie having some very unkind attitudes towards Mark and herself.  
  
To explain more lets add some more context to the case study:  
  
Katie might have slept with Mark two times and found out that Mark slept with Anna inbetween. Katie gets very upset. What reasons does she have for getting upset?  
  
First, lets look at some reasons that I think would be a good reason to get upset, i.e. they do not indicate she has unkind attitudes towards Mark:  
  
1.She is worried about STDs. A healthy concern for her own wellbeing.  
  
2. She is worried Mark will be less committed to her in the future. Reasonable.  
  
Reasons I think sexual jealousy can be a sign of extreme unkindness:  
  
1. It reduces Mark to a sexual object. The implication is that after he has had sex with Anna interacting with him has become less worthwhile to Katie. Why should someones sexual history ever dictate how we treat them?  
  
2. Katie disrespects herself. A negative response to Mark having sex with someone else may indicate that Katie has placed some of her self esteem in "being the only one Mark has sex with". This again, reduces her to a sexual object. If she was truely enjoying all the different aspects of interacting with Mark then what he gets up to while not hanging out with her would not bother her so much.  
  
Notes  
  
I'm aware that lots of people might disagree - I am kinda looking for help changing my view on this, and being able to believe that I am wrong.  
  
Don't embarass us all by going ad hominin
