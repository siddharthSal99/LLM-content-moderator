Title: CMV: workplaces shouldn’t organise events outside of work hours, even parties 
Post Text: I don’t mind if staff organise a (voluntary) drink after work, but if the manager invites people to drinks, then it’s inappropriate as people see it as an obligation.

I don’t personally want to be friends with people outside of work. I spend more time than I want to with them, more time than with my family. So when I’m invited to ‘teambuilding’ events, I really do question why these can’t happen in the 40+ hours a week I spend with ‘the team’. 

I like them enough btw, I have friends I have met at work. 

This isn’t a rant, I just question why there is some kind of perceived ownership of an employee’s time outside of work. 

 Imo it should end when you clock in and out.
