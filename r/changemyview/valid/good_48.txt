Title: CMV: Anyone Can Cheat in the Wrong Environment 
Post Text: I recently had a conversation with my partner where I shared my view that not everyone will, but anyone can cheat if put in the wrong situation.

In my view cheating is almost akin to drug use. For me and most people, they would never consider trying something like cocaine, however, if you start spending time with friends who use it and attend parties where it’s present it’s way more likely to happen. 

The same is true for cheating in my head. If you find the wrong person and spend too much time in the wrong circumstances it’s way more likely to happen. 

The similarities are there even in the way I’ve heard people try and explain how to avoid cheating with the famous Nancy Reagan catch phrase “just say no”. 

It just seems obvious to me that your environment shapes the choices you make and this should play a role in deciding what social setting you put yourself in.

So Reddit, please share with me any perspectives you have on this subject so I can incorporate them in my thinking.
