Title: CMV: If we allowed people to get 'un-canceled' by doing good things, this would be a net positive for the world. 
Post Text: Under our current social system, it's possible for someone to get 'canceled' for one thing they did or said many years ago, with no hope for redemption.

Here's the problem with that: if there is no hope for redemption, the only people who will still try to redeem themselves with good works are the ones who are truly good people in the first place. But if truly good people are being 'canceled', that's a huge problem in and of itself.

Where is the incentive for bad or neutral people to improve themselves or to do good works?

I am not saying we should forget what people did, or ever trust a dangerous person again. That's not my argument at all.

But if what someone did was say the 'wrong' political opinion, they should be able to redeem themselves by providing significant help to whatever group was harmed by their 'wrong' opinion. For example, if someone was canceled because they said what Hamas did to Israeli civilians was moral and good, maybe all that person needs to do to redeem themselves is spend every Saturday for one year doing pro-bono work for a charity that gives free medical aid to Israeli civilians.

If what someone did was extremely harmful, like physically harming another person, they should have to work extremely hard to redeem themselves. Maybe they would need to dedicate years or even decades to helping others in order to earn this redemption.

Of course some crimes are unforgivable, and some people cannot be redeemed.

To change my view, you would have to convince me that the benefit of continuing to exclude 'canceled' people outweighs the potential good of whatever they would have to do in order to redeem themselves and be included again.
