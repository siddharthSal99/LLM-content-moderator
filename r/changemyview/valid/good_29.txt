Title: CMV: This new NBA in-season tournament will do nothing to engage the fans. 
Post Text: Here is my understanding of the new in-season tournament: a set number of regular seasons games will count towards an in-season tournament. At the end of this set number of regular season games, the team that does the best wins the new NBA Cup.

If I am wrong there, correct me.

Now, here's my issue: I don't "get" why this is something I, the fan, would be engaged with. For what it's worth, I'm a Lakers fan. The Lakers have won 17 NBA Championships in their history. What I, the fan, care about is winning the NBA Finals. Just like it's safe to assume a hockey fan would want their team to win the Stanley Cup, or a baseball fan would want their team to win the World Series. Why should I, the fan, care about the Lakers winning the NBA Cup if they don't win the NBA Finals?

As evidence, every major North American sport that I'm aware of has some kind of trophy or reward for winning your league or conference. Baseball has the pennant, for example. And yet how often does the typical fan celebrate their team winning that? They would either focus on the World Series, or completely ignore the pennant because they lost the World Series.

That's where I am confused by this new NBA in-season tournament. If the purpose is to make me more interested in the regular season, I don't really see how. If my team has a good regular season, they will qualify for the playoffs anyway. If they win the NBA Cup but lose the NBA Finals, it will still be seen as a failure of a season. If it's supposed to engage the players, well, same issue, aren't they going to want to win the NBA Finals and the Larry O'Brein Trophy more than the NBA Cup?
