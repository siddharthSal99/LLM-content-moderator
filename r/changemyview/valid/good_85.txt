Title: CMV: Filming football play signals is not more unethical than watching game film 
Post Text: There is a recent stir against a University of Michigan employee for going to public games and filming public signals that the sideline makes to indicate a certain play to the players on the field. I don’t know all the details but my view is still the same regardless

View: I do not believe filming public signals is more unethical than studying public game film.

The end goal of stealing signals is to get an advantage and be able to predict what the opposing team is calling and hopefully have an audible that would counter effectively. A few premises I have:

- a signal does not have a definitive outlook for the actual play call based on the outside looking in. (Example below)
- watching game film is essentially getting the same benefit (tracking play calls, tendencies, strategies) in a different way. 
- this is something every team could do while in person playing. 

There are *easy* ways around this. You could have the captain on the field wear a wristband that changes every possession. So you would make the same signals, but the plays would change. You could also have different signalers that try to throw off the opposing team (most teams already do this). Or you could make new signals each week (I understand this is much more difficult). I would almost invite opponents to do this and try to mislead them. 

Key words: public games, public signals. I am not advocating for stealing private practice information or radio interference/tampering. 

Disclaimer: I don’t work in football or care for UM.
