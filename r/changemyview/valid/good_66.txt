Title: CMV: I do not think it’s wrong for a property owner to not allow individuals with certain criminal history to rent their property 
Post Text: I will admit that the justice/criminal system is not perfect in America. 

That being said, I don’t think property owners should be on the forefront of change when it comes to getting ex cons acclimated back into society.

It makes sense for  it wanting a career criminal to be in the midst of others. Does that automatically mean they will be an issue? No. Does that mean non ex con guest won’t be an issue? No.

But some people have proven themselves not to be a model citizen and have no indication that they ever plan to be one. A criminal record can shed some light on that and it’s reasonable for owners to not what those kind of people on their property.



While it may be a *small* part of a bigger issue over all, I don’t think there are any negatives by not letting people with certain records live on their property.
