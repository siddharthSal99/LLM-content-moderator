Title: CMV: In the Jacksfilms/SSSniperWolf situation, YT was wrong to imply "both sides" equivalency 
Post Text: In the ongoing conflict between the Youtubers Jacksfilms and SSSniperWolf, Youtube made the following statement after demonetising SSSniperwolf following her Doxing of JacksFilms

&gt;Confirming SSSniperWolf has received a temporary monetization suspension per Creator Responsibility policies. Off platform actions that put others’ personal safety at risk harm our community &amp; the behavior on ***both sides*** isn’t what we want on YT. Hoping everyone helps move this convo to a better place.

EMPHASIS ADDED

What I cannot understand here is how there is any kind of "both sides"-ism here.

Prior to the doxing, Jacksfilms had been running a critical campaign of videos where he was making the quite reasonable point that the vast majority of SSSniperwolf's content consists of content stolen from other people which she then uploads in a non-transformative manner, without crediting the original creators.

This is critique and cultural commentary. It is something that we see all over youtube and is entirely apt and appropriate for the platform.

SSSniperwolf's content by contrast was taking material from many other content creators, and monetising it for herself. By proxy this was stealing money from them.

I don't really see how there is two equivalent sides here, in the way youtube is implying. Even before the doxing, this was not a contest of moral equivalency. One person was using scummy internet money-making schemes, and the other was calling them out on it.

Some people have called Jacksfilms "obsessive" but even if we accept that as true, I don't see how it comes close to what Sssniperwolf is doing.

Am I missing something here? What makes these two parties close to equivalent? Anything?

Even if it's just YT saying something like "we don't want drama on the platform" they allow and encourage many other cultural critique channels of many kinds in many other places. I don't really understand where Jacksfilms' actions falls into anything approaching unacceptable
