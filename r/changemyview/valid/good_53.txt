Title: CMV: There's no such thing as sports referees calling too many penalties, if each penalty was legit and warranted. 
Post Text: I often see fans complaining that referees throw the flag or blow the whistle too frequently and that this is ruining the game.

The problem is, **these fans are often referring to instances where the player was in fact, actually, committing a blatant violation of the rules.**

What these sports fans are saying, then, is that *they want the officiating crew to deliberately turn a blind eye to a certain amount of clear fouls for the sake of "not bogging down the game's flow."* They're saying, for instance, that if a team commits 10 fouls, they want referees to only call 3 or 5 of them.

I would argue that such a stance would actually do **more** harm to the game. If you send a message to players that "We'll allow a certain amount of rule violation," then players will deliberately try to get in the maximum amount of fouling that they think they can get away with.

Of course, this only applies in cases of clear fouls - if an action is in that grey area where the refs can't quite decide whether it warrants a flag/whistle/penalty or not, I'd argue that it should be allowed to slide. But if teams commit 40 clear and obvious violations in a game, then the referee should penalize 40 times. To do so otherwise would undermine the game's integrity.
