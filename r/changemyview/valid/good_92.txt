Title: CMV: The U.S. highway and interstate infrastructure is dangerous and inefficient. It would've been better if the majority of investment went to developing and modernizing railways. 
Post Text: My view on this matter is that the U.S. has dug itself into a terrible situation that regularly requires it to invest in a fundamentally inefficient and inherently more dangerous system of mass transit. Here are some gathered statistics that support my view.  

I'm arguing that the U.S. made a mistake and it WOULD'VE  been better if it had invested in rail transportation. 


https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2021-05/Budget-Highlights2022\_052721\_FINAL.PDF Here is a review of the recent U.S. budget allocations for infrastructure. Over the next five years, the planned budget allocates 35,000 million dollars more investing into just the maintenance of roads compared to the investment into improving and modernizing the rail network.

  
"The Nationâ€™s rail networks have the potential to offer safe, reliable, efficient, and climate-friendly alternatives for moving people and freight. However, unlike highways and transit, rail lacks a multi-year funding stream to address deferred maintenance, enhance existing corridors, and build new lines in high-potential locations. There are currently projects just waiting to be funded that will give millions more Americans reliable and fast inter-city train service. " - U.S. DOT

  
"In absolute terms, the picture is clear. Worldwide, road users account for about 71% of transport CO2 emissions, with railway companies making up less than 1.8%, next to 12.3% for aviation and 14.3% for shipping" - https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/greener-travel-car-or-rail, who cited International Energy Agency and International Union of Railways. Every single person traveling in a vehicle that can hold 4-5 more people spatially is just extremely wasteful for our resources. Investing in railway transportation would have made travel a lot less environmental pollutant.

  
In terms of efficiency of travel times, driving a car is currently faster than riding a train. However, I'd argue that is undoubtedly attributed to how much the U.S. has already invested in making highways the shortest distance possible from one point to the other, pushing aside railways, and making trains less efficient in time-to-distance ratios. 

There is also the question of space efficiency. There are anywhere between 800 million to 2 billion parking spaces in America, with 5% of urban areas being specifically designated for parking.(https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2019/11/27/parking-dominates-our-cities-but-do-we-really-see-it) With the average parking space being between 300 to 350 square feet, this a gigantic waste of land and space just to cater to all of the vehicles on the road.  


If U.S. infrastructure developed railways in a more meaningful way, there would be much less of a need for the wastefully distributed parking spaces across every building. Buildings, in general, would be much closer together to help with walking from one place to another, meaning that overall the country would save a lot more space for nature or even more development.

Now onto the issue of how dangerous the U.S. highway and road system is. There were over 5 million police-reported car accidents in the U.S. in 2020, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), a 22% decrease from 2019. A total of 38,824 traffic-related deaths resulted from 35,766 fatal accidents in 2020, which is the highest fatality count since 2007. According to data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, there were an average of 1,760 train derailments per year in the U.S. from 1990 to 2021. On average there are four deaths by train derailment each year. These statistics really speak for themselves I mean 38,824 vs 4.

There is a possibly higher chance of infections spreading due to public transport. For this, my rebuttal would be that sufficient sanitation actions could be enacted to reduce risks, and the deaths of infections would pale in comparison to the fatal crashes that occur on the road.   


The main argument is that people genuinely enjoy the freedom and comfort of owning their own vehicles. The only reason vehicles equal freedom is that there are very few places that anyone can get to without owning a car because the entire country is way too spaced out. Also, this is a post specifically about the highway and interstate road system, I'd imagine that local transit roads would still be necessary.
