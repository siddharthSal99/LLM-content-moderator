Title: CMV: Making Cheating on a Spouse Illegal Can Strengthen Marriages and Uphold Values 
Post Text: I think making it illegal to cheat on your spouse has some good reasons. It can make people more committed in their marriages by discouraging cheating and building trust.

If cheating is against the law, it might make folks think twice before having affairs because they could face legal trouble.

This law could also help protect the feelings and money of the person who was cheated on, especially if it leads to a divorce.

By banning cheating, we'd be saying that faithfulness in relationships is really important, which is a value many people share.

And there's a bonus: it could lower the hurt and health risks from cheating and prevent the spread of diseases.
