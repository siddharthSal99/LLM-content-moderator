Title: CMV: Free market capitalism is an idealization of a planet with infinite resources. 
Post Text: Everyone likes free-market economy, as its the basis of an ever-growing economic infrastructure: the capitalist system. But, have you ever thought about the actual implications of a non-regulated market? Every single thing we sell is related in some way or another to resources of the planet. In FME, selling derivates of natural resources is just "transforming" nature in order to introduce our product in market's offer supply. If the right conditions are met, this will increase the demand of that product, wich in turn lets us invest in resource extraction. This will ultimately increase offer, and then an "economic loop" can start, powered only earth's resources and capitalist market  relations. One does not need a PHD in mathematics to see how easily this can turn the numbers into the depletion of the original resource, ultimately privating ALL humanity of its benefits. Saying this is an idealization of reality is far from the cold facts: we are constantly transforming _clean air_ into _pollution and factories_, _energy_ into _power and an increase in temperature_, _free land_ into _urbanization and population growth_... But what can we do when those resources end up in depletion?  The answer is clear: be extinguished.
