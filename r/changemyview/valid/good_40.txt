Title: CMV: The term Zionist is used a weapon against Jews and has big antisemitic undertones 
Post Text: EDIT: I'm amending my view to say it's not that people shouldn't use the term Zionist, they should just be aware of how others might use it as a way to mask their antisemitism. People should make clear attempts to push antisemitism from their surroundings so that the discussion regarding Zionism stays on point and not used to further push hate towards marginalized groups who are unrelated to the point in question.

The main things that changed my view is considering how Anti-Israeli protests are now used as vehicles to hide antisemitism, so at this point it really doesn't matter if you use anti-zionism or anti-israeli. And if you switch to a third term, that one would be used as well. 

Instead we need to be aware of antisemites and make an effort to remove them from the discussion. We must not ignore or belittle the attacks going on against Jews right now and ignore the connection to anti-Israeli rallies. Looking away is wrong. 

When it was happening to Muslims in the 2000s,  we didn't look away. We realized legitimate criticism of Islam was being used as a vehicle to paddle Islamophobia. The left has course corrected a bit too far IMO where there can't be any criticism of Islam, as to not seem Islamophobic. We should find a balance, but doing one for Muslims and the opposite for Jews - well, that certainly is not a good look. 

\----------------------------------  


\*\*I'll start with the view and then explain:\*\*Using the term Zionist is a often a dogwhistle attack at Jews and is incredibly antisemitic, some use it legitimately, but because of the difficulty in distinguishing the two and the accusatory nature of use by almost all people - it should be seen as antisemitic and removed from speech.

**Now to clarify:**

First, I am aware that Zionist is a term Jews created and are using themselves in Israel all the time in legitimate use. To those unfamiliar, it is a term derived from the word Zion - another name for Jerusalem, and embodies the hopes and wishes of Jews in exile to one day return home and rebuild an Israeli country to call their own.To put simply - It is an ideological view that there should be a Jewish homeland for Jews and it should be in Zion. And while there are a lot of different views within that ideology about how, when and where the base concept is that.

And it is also okay to be critical against that view ideology without being antisemitic\*.

**So why do I still think it's antisemitic?**

0 - Preface - I'll preface by saying this is not universal, and there might be plenty who use the term Zionist in good faith and have no ill intent. But because it's indistinguishable from those who do have ill intent, the good people end up being a shield for antisemites to hide behind and whitewash their racist hate.1 - **Negative context of the term** \- So to start, it is quite clear that when many discuss Zionism outside of Israel and the Jewish world, they intend it as a negative action of taking other people's land and forcibly building a country in it. It connects Israel's current actions which are perceived as genocide and attempted ethnocleansing of another population in the purpose of realizing the full Zionist dream. It looks at the actions of 1948 through the lens of the end results of today, and sees the whole concept of Zionism as corrupt and poisonous from the very roots of it.And thus for many people, supporting Zionism is for all intents and purposes supporting genocide.

2 - **Interlinking the (negative) term with Jewish people** \- Because Zionism deals with the Jewish population, it ends being a question of each Jew if they support Zionism or not. Nowadays, it is being asked in a pretty aggressive manner towards many Jews whether or not they're Zionists. Even removing the negative context, this has antisemitic undertones since you're posing a question only towards one ethnic group and when you add the context, you're basically putting their backs against the wall, painting a target and then giving them one last chance to correct themselves.It is an attempt to separate the "clean" Jews from the "dirty" ones, and while it's a question now - how long before it's an assumption made towards every Jew without giving them time to distance themselves.

This is basically linking the two terms together, and ignoring the fact Zionists can be (and are) non-Jews too.

3 - **Using the terms interchangeably** \- In places where antisemitism is more widespread, like many Arab countries, the two terms are used pretty interchangeably, with some organizations only using the term Zionist as to avoid being seen as antisemitic. And whether or not the use is purposeful or a a byproduct of years of rhetorics against Israel - the result remains the same. A Jew is a Zionist and a Zionist is a Jew.

4 - **The historical use of the term to raise antisemitism in the world** \- When we look back to the start of Zionism, and the previous wave of antisemitism in the world, we can see that anti-zionism was used heavily as a tool to spread antisemitism around the world. The fact that there really was a Zionist organization in the start of the 20th century helped it be a pointed weapon towards Jews, creating big conspiracy theories about Zionists and their plans for world domination. Most famously, the 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion' was the biggest fabricated weapon to target Jews indirectly. It originated in Russia as part of the protests and pogroms against Jews which displaced and killed thousands of Jews.It was later adopted by Hitler and used to showcase reasons to hate the Jews, pointing and linking Zionism and Jews. While internally, Hitler didn't discuss Zionism much - externally, he used it as the primary export with which to spread antisemitism in other countries, most specifically, in Arab countries.And it worked too, Arab leaders were already weary of Zionist attempts to settle in Palestine, buying land and immigrating there in masse, and the 1917 Balfour Declaration served as proof that something sinister is brewing. So when Nazi relations with Arab countries tightened, it was easy to point the finger towards all the Jews living in their lands and paint them as evil Zionists that should be killed or expelled (ironically pushing them to Israel).Jews living in many of these Arab countries did not leave due to Zionism, but rather being pushed out for their religion/ethnicity. So there's a demonstrable example of how Anti-Zionism ends up in Antisemitism.

5 - **Anti-Israel vs Anti-Zionism** \- Most anti-Zionist are also not really arguing against the ideological belief that Jewish people should have a home but rather the current actions of the Israel government which might be rooted in Zionism, but aren't necessarily linked. Anti-Zionism might have had a purpose in the years leading up to 1948 since Israel was still not a fact and one could argue against the idea or concept of its formation. But it's been 75 years since, and at this point any beef one has against Israel should be against Israel. There's no reason to be against Zionism since Zionist has already been realized.But more to the point, if you object to what you perceive as genocide or ethnic cleansing, and object to Israel's apartheid practices against Palestine, you should object to Israel or Israel's government. Zionism has nothing to do with it (Well, I concede that Israelis are still motivated by Zionism and one can say that the current government is lead by extreme zionistic ideology. But why muddle the water here when it's easier to stay clean and just object and criticize Israel's current regime).

6\* - **Complexity of being anti-Zionist** \- Even if we say there's merit here to be criticize Zionism since Israel's government is lead by that ideology, what exactly is anti-Zionism? Is it being against Israel as a concept in general, is it against Israel being where it is, or is it just against the idea of  Israel expanding?Since at the base of it Zionism is the ideology that Jews should have a homeland. Being against that, is in a way, being against Jews having an ethnic home. Something that 90%+ all other ethnic groups have and something that all big religions have too, a religious country that protects it. Christianity has plenty (Greece, Denmark, Norway, Argentina, Hungary, Iceland, the Vatican obviously) and Muslim obviously has many countries were Islam is the dominant and protected religion. If you object to the idea of a religious state, why not object to those of other religions?

If you accept that Judaism should have a home and only object to the location, then you only partially object to Zionism which makes it harder to be completely anti-Zionist, but more to the point - Where then? If you object to Zionism at this point in time - are you not just calling for the banishment of 8M Jews from what they've known as their home for the past 75 years, most born to only know it as their home. How is anti-Zionism then not a call to ethnic cleansing?(And if you only object to further expansion and current occupation, then you're pretty much objecting to Israel's actions first and foremost so why tie it with Zionism when that makes it much less clear what you object to).

7 - **Parallels to Jihad -** Just to paint a wider picture here. As a Jewish person, asking me pointedly if I'm a Zionist only because of my ethnicity (as many Jews are practically atheists) especially when it's clear you see Zionism as evil is no different than asking a Muslim if he's a Jihadist. Jihad too is an idea that is even more complex than Zionism and can have plenty of positive implications, but when one asks that of a Muslims, they're obviously relating it to a the negative aspect and ready to attack them. We'd obviously understand how that's wrong even just asking that question, regardless of intention.So why is it not even seen as problematic against Jews?

In summary, calling someone a Zionist can be a slur since many intend it as an accusation of "support for occupation, genocide and ethno-cleansing". That term is only being thrown towards Jews and many use it as a tool to separate Jews who you can hate and Jews you shouldn't. In the past it was used to breed undercover antisemitism and since it's only used against Jews but has "legitimate" grounds it's nearly impossible to distinguish between legitimate use of the term and a hate-crime use of it.Because of it, this term should really not be used by anyone who is not antisemitic and can instead be replaced with anti Israel rhetorics which is what most non antisemitic people refer to anyway.
