Title: CMV: Anyone can be successful in the music industry with connections. 
Post Text: I’m not saying that there aren’t people with talent in the music industry because that’s obviously not the case.

Using rap music as an example tho if someone had enough money or friends in the industry in theory there’s nothing stopping them from buying a good beat, paying someone to write the lyrics, and then auto-tuning your voice to make it sound good.

The only thing I think would take actual skill is the acting ability required take to appear genuinely talented or that you actually live a rapper lifestyle that you don’t live/didn’t grow up in.
