Title: CMV: Pure democracy would not be a good political system. 
Post Text: I am all for democracy, and to be honest, I think many countries (including the USA) would benefit from being more democratic. People should get to vote on a wider variety of issues, governmental organizations should be more transparent, corporations (especially weapons corporations) should not have any significant amount of power over the government, and nobody should be allowed to bribe politicians.

However, there can be such a thing as too much democracy. I contend that pure democracy (in which anything the majority votes for is approved and acted on) would be destructive and unsustainable.

I cannot think of a single example of a world government which is ruled by pure democracy. If you know of one, please share it with me. I've only seen fictional examples of this type of government... and these stories do not end well. Why? Because in practice, pure democracy would almost invariably devolve into mob rule.

Imagine a situation in which everyone could vote on everything, and the results of that vote decided what laws would exist and what actions the government would take. Every official, every ambassador, every police officer would be elected. So far, so good, right?

But what would happen if, say, a person were accused of a crime, or simply deemed to be unworthy? In a pure democracy, they would not be tried by a jury of their peers and sentenced by a judge. They would be tried and sentenced by public opinion. 

If a majority of people said "Let's kill (X unpopular person)... who would stop them? The government would have to honor the will of the people. And even if there were laws which said "Due process must be followed"... it would be very easy to change those laws, as long as a majority of the people agreed.

Or what if there were a law or political system that sounded good on paper, but was actually completely impractical? Maybe a lot of people would vote for this, not having the political or legal knowledge to understand why enacting this law would cause hardship or chaos. What would happen then? Under a pure democracy, the new law change would move forward. Imagine if everyone voted "All citizens should get 1 million dollars from the government", because of course everyone wants that. Where on Earth would this money come from? Who can imagine what chaos would ensue when the people demanded their million dollars?

Or imagine a case where one country attacked another, and people felt an emotional need to retaliate. What if, for example, a majority of Americans wanted to bomb Russia because they invaded Ukraine? A seasoned elected leader would have the experience to understand that this is not necessarily a wise action, even though many people may find it emotionally satisfying. But in a pure democracy, if more than half of the people voted yes... wouldn't that be the end of civilization as we know it?

If you can explain to me how a pure democracy could in practice be reasonably peaceful and sustainable, or better yet, give me a real-world example of a medium-sized or large country which functioned for a long time as a pure democracy, I will gladly change my view. I am, after all, a very big fan of democracy.
