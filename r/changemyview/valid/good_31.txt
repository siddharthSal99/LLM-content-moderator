Title: CMV: American interest in the Middle East is entirely made up. 
Post Text: UPDATE: Alright my mind is changed. Obviously there is a ton of interest in this region. Although, I don't like that the United States has involved itself in the Middle East, there isn't a clear way to disengage without entirely destabilizing the world. Thanks everyone.

I have yet to hear a convincing argument detailing why the United States need to be in the Middle East. The United States have troops in Yemen, Syria, and other nations. It occupies and attacks people for reasons that I cannot find. Most people argue that it's because of terrorism and spreading democracy.

As far as I'm concerned, these terrorist groups would not be so large, if the USA were not occupying these countries. Also, what business do we have to go in and force these countries to be democratic? The people decide what they want, not the United States. The USA would need to stay in these countries for generations until it forced the people to bend to their will. 

As it pertains to America protecting its ally Israel.  Why is it the USAs job to get in the middle. I just don't get why the US needs to come to attack other countries for the sake of protecting Israel. We already provied plenty of defense. I think the US getting involved is making the conflict worse and making relations with other countries tenuous. 

The only reason I can see is that the people in the government are making money off the conflict and using these countries to fight proxy wars (to avoid direct war with Russia). I don't have a whole lot of evidence to my viewpoint. 

I'd greatly appreciate some booke recs explaining the conflicts in the middle east and why America should/shouldn't be in these conflicts.
