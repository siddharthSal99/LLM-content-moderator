Title: CMV: Fulton county should not have indicted former President Donald J. Trump. 
Post Text: I am a Georgia resident and I support/voted for President Biden, Senator Warnock, and Senator Ossoff. I am proud to be a part of the change in Georgia to make the Democratic policies a reality.

For weeks I followed the Fulton county indictment of former President Donald J. Trump and while I disagree with 90% of his platform/actions, I am starting to think the indictment is unreasonable. Here are my reasons:

1. **A higher degree of evidences should be required to indict a President/Former President/Presidential Candidate**: I understand that the goal is we are equal under the law. But we already have unwritten practice in place to make exceptions, such as the 60-day rule which traditionally avoids taking investigative steps close to an election that could influence how people vote. To bring any legal actions against Trump, a former President and a Presidential candidate, the bar to clear should be higher than any ordinary citizens.

2. **Lack of Direct Evidences**: I followed the indictment for weeks and while there are strong evidences to suggest that Trump supporters execute a fake electors' plot with forged federal documents and impersonation of public officers; I fail to see a single text, email, phone call, or record of verbal communication that directly implicate Trump in his acknowledge of the plot. That is why, I presume, that only Fulton county DA decided to indict Trump due to the availability of RICO laws in the state, and not in other states/counties where similar plots took place.

3. **Reliability of RICO on the basis of legality**: I am not a legal expert and my legal knowledge are based on TV shows/movies/documentaries I watched so I am probably just asking for help here. While RICO has a lower threshold of burden of proof where the prosecution only need to show that Trump belongs to a criminal enterprise and establish a pattern of criminal behavior of said enterprise. Well, how do you separate a Presidential Administration/Campaign from a criminal enterprise? Trump can very well argue that he does not know anything about the plot, and just because his team went on to organize criminal acts, that doesn't mean Trump is part of the criminal enterprise, he was simply their boss from a legal standpoint. I understand that several of the co-defendants already turned, so here is my next point.

4. **Reliability of RICO on the basis of morality**: RICO is designed to incentivize mid-level crime bosses to turn on their head of enterprise. By giving sweetheart deals to folks like Powell and Ellis with 0 jail time, the county DA is basically begging them to turn on Trump to save themselves. But is this morally reprehensible? I watched TV shows like "Life" and other cases where those who committed crimes turn on their boss from a legitimate business in order to get lighter sentence, despite the fact that the boss have zero knowledge/intention to commit said crimes. Even if I believe that Trump probably know about the crimes, the only real evidences against him in this case are the turning witness testimonies, which can very well be false due to the incentives given by the prosecutors.

In conclusion, should Fulton county bring out an, at best, 50/50 case against a President/candidate with the real possibility of clouding voters' judgement? In the end, shouldn't we the Democrats go out and vote next Nov to defeat Trumpism at the election instead of playing legal games?
