Title: CMV: Time for Repair/Returns Should Be Compensated 
Post Text: So, I'll freely admit that this is just something that has popped into my head recently. I've had a spate of problems that other people caused, but that I've had to take a not insignificant portion of time to deal with. In the first case,  I was rear-ended by a driver who admitted fault. In the more recent case, I was shipped an electronic device that didn't function as advertised.

In both cases, the other party was made to pay for the damages that they caused, but they weren't made to pay for my time in solving the issue. How is that fair? They get to waste my time for nothing. The guy who rear-ended me should be required to pay for the several hours I spent getting body work done. The Amazon seller that shipped me the device should be required to pay me a fee for repacking their device and sending it back to them. I didn't ask to spend my time on either of these endeavors; why should I be asked to pay for them with my time?

Deltas will be liberally awarded for any reasonable explanation as to why buyers or victims shouldn't be required to front the time involved in remedying these situations without pay.
