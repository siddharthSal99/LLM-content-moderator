Title: CMV: Marriage isn't worth it for a modern man at all 
Post Text: Before anyone goes on and saying how this is usual and you are just 22, this is a compilation of my personal experience. I am not saying you should go divorce your wife either. Just need someone to talk me into or out of marriage. 

I have watched a total of 4 marriages fail, and all resulted in the man getting absolutely shafted, even with a prenup. One was my uncle, his ex wife put a false domestic violence claim on him and it was proven that he never did it, but still spent 2 days in county holding. Second was my cousin, who married someone making around his income, but she still walked away with the house, car, and most of the properties. Third was my friend (27M) who got cheated on during his deployment, and she walked away with half his income as spousal support (thank god they didn't have children). Fourth was my other army friend, and he got cheated on during his time in the hospital as he was recovering from a partial hip replacement. 

Statistically speaking, 50% of marriages fail. Would you fly on a plane with a 50% chance of crashing? With women initiating 70% divorces, why take a risk? 

But married men live longer. Why live longer in suffering than a shorter happier life? Why should I have to ask my future wife if I want to buy a motorcycle with my money after contributing to the bills? Why should I have a man cave in the house I paid for? 

But married men are happier. Only for the first two years, after that it diminishes. ([https://ifstudies.org/blog/does-getting-married-really-make-you-happier](https://ifstudies.org/blog/does-getting-married-really-make-you-happier))

On reddit and other sites have proven time and time again that men should overlook their feelings when a child or family is involved. Even to go as far as accept children born from affairs years after finding out years after. Even to go as far as demonizing men for requesting paternity and other genetic tests to confirm it is in fact their child. Or when men don't want to be a father, and even while paying child support, being called a deadbeat. 

Over and over again everything that goes wrong in a marriage is automatically the man's fault. Man cheats because his wife doesn't want any intimacy, he is the devil incarnate. Woman cheats because her man doesn't provide the intimacy, it is his fault automatically for not providing for her. Man want's his wife to be a stay at home parent, he is controlling. He wants his wife to work, he is broke. 

Even asking for a prenuptial agreement is seen as a asshole move nowadays. 

I am not an incel, I have no issues with women. But until the institution of marriage changes to provide TRUE benefit to men, please tell me some good reasons to get married in the 21st century as a man. The simple cost-benefit analysis shows that you lose more than gain.
