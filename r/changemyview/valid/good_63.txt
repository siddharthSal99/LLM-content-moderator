Title: CMV: 1) Speakerships, Committee chairs and committee assignments should be randomly selected in the US House of Representatives, 2) committee votes to be anonymous while final floor votes remain onymous, 3)Representatives from states with more than 1 Rep would be elected at large for the whole state 
Post Text: Though these 3 reforms may seem only sort of related,  I would say that they are interdependent on alleviating legislative logjams and corruption (as defined as government not acting in accordance to the will of the public). Currently the rules of the House are set by the party leadership Republicans have term limits for committee chairs while the Democrats do not, so all of these reforms are Constitutional, though the 3rd reform would need to be imposed indirectly sort of like how 18 year drinking age was raised to 21 with threat of federal highway funds being withheld to make a national standard.  


1)  By making the positions of leadership [sortition](https://www.wordnik.com/words/sortition), and eliminating the current determinative factor of money raised into leadership PACs, making it near random everyone elected to the House having an equal chance to be Speaker, committee chair, and committee assignments would divorce individual Representatives from their scope of influence every election disincentivizing lobbyists and campaign funders to de facto bribe elected officials - or at the very least dissipate the effect of giving money to specific Representatives. For example Rep. Jones used to get $500k from Industry 'A' because she was the chair on the committee that birthed laws regulating 'A', after the reform Industry 'A' would have to spread their contributions across 435 possible chairpeople who all have equal chance to become that committee chair.   


2) Committee votes are where lobbyists can have a narrow focus on specific language of legislation that is most beneficial to their clients, if the members of the committee is random and the individuals votes on specific motions is anonymous then the members would be more free to vote their conscience and regardless to their public statements vote without any corroboration of how they voted depriving committee members the ability to trade their votes for campaign contributions or any other benefits seeking to influence the legislation. The full floor vote out of committee would still be available to public and that would be where individual Reps be held accountability for their voting record.  


3)  By having every state's delegation be elected at large, where if a state has 3 seats, the entire state's electorate would be free to vote for their preferred candidate and the op 3 vote getters would form the congressional delegation. Parties could run as many candidates as they wanted or just run one candidate (a strategy minor parties might use just to get the minimum vote threshold especially in larger populated states with lowest vote threshold). This is the means of which the Senate is elected in the Philippines but on a national scale not for provinces/state level. Doing this would allow for the voters of the minority party (GOP in CA, NY, IL, MD, MA, &amp; CT, Dems in TX, NC, OH, MS, FL, ID, &amp; UT)  to get some representation as well as eliminate the ability to gerrymander districts and have politicians select their voters rather than have voters elect their politicians. Once elected, the representatives would have more incentive to work on behalf of the entire state rather than just a slim portion of a district's constituency in partisan primaries.  


Whether or not these reforms would be implemented is not what this CMV is about, rather whether or not these reforms are effective at mitigating corruption as defined as elected officials not acting in accordance to the will of their voters.
