Title: CMV: Being a landlord isn’t really a job 
Post Text: Sitting around, ignoring maintenance requests, and waiting for money to roll in isn't a job. Yes, you have to maintain the property, but that's true of literally any property. "but the landlord provides housing"- not really. In many instances, the property was already there when they bought it. They provide it in the same way a ticket scalper "provides" concert tickets.

“Why don’t you just buy a house”. We would if they weren’t being hoarded or if housing wasn’t so damn expensive. It’s not 1975 when a down payment was $4 and credit scores weren’t a thing.

*EDIT: I’m starting to see why I thought the way I did and my perspective has changed a bit. Thank y’all.
