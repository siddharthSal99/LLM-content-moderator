Title: CMV: Tombstone (With Val Kilmer) is the best western movie. 
Post Text: The tombstone with Val Kilmer was the Best Western movie that ever existed. It is my absolute all-time favorite Western movie. And in my top five favorite movies of all time. Val Kilmer's betrayal of Doc Holliday remains one of my favorite character betrayals of all time. "I'm you're huckleberry." I don't think there's ever been a line in a movie that stuck with me more than that. I loved it, I was upset with it and said it all the time. On top of it it's a unique take on a historical event, its the only reason I know about that battle anyhow. I was so obsessed with the movie that I researched everything about it and I was so excited to find out that it was based on true events. However loosely it was.

I've watched hundreds of Western movies. Including unforgivable, the quick and the dead, 3:10 to Yuma, and just so many more. Above all I can't find anybody that I like better than Doc Holliday and that is the reason that this remains my favorite movie.
