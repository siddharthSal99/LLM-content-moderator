Title: cmv: Southern whites should be their own ethnic group 
Post Text: No I'm not a racist, part of my family and ancestors are black americans.
No I'm not looking to secede lol, I want to make america great for the first time.
No I'm not alt right, I'm a leftist.
No I'm not trolling, I really believe this.

There's a wiki page about white southerners and how there's been ongoing debate to make them their own ethnic group (I'm having trouble linking it). Plus articles and whatnot.

I think considering the distinctly different history and culture among this group in contrast with the rest of america, it would be very beneficial to make them their own ethnic group. They need to be untangled from the rest of white americans because there is next to nothing in common and it hurts progress lumping them together.
It'll also, hopefully, force people to regard them beyond simple stereotyping and bigotry and take the time to learn and dissect them, which will ultimately help strengthen american cohesiveness.

I'm specifically talking about southern whites who were here pre-civil war and their descendants as of this moment. But that might change with more info.
