Title: CMV: INDOOR CAT OWNERS ARE SELFISH 
Post Text: I believe that keeping a cat indoors is akin to keeping a rabbit in a small cage, a fish in a tiny tank, etc. In recent years it seems that there has been a push for more responsible pet ownership with regards to necessary space and stimulation, but this doesn't apply to cats. 

My argument is that MOST cat owners will say that allowing their cat outside is dangerous to the cat and that is why they want to keep their cat indoors. 

If someone is keeping a cat indoors due to concern regarding bird population, etc, that's an entirely different matter and is irrelevant to the claim I'm making here.

In the decision to keep a cat indoors due to consideration of the cat (as opposed to considerations of the surrounding wildlife, pargmatic issues, etc), there seem to be different frameworks that guide the decision. One is the prioritization of life, another is the prioritization of a good life. These two can end up converse to one another when a good life involves a heightened risk of death. 

The cat cannot advocate for themselves so we make judgment calls on their behalf. My argument is that most people who want to keep their cat indoors are choosing this not for their cats total well being (good life), but for selfish reasons regarding their own experience of their pet (life). 

If this were not the case then I think a lot more cat owners would be allowing their cat outside because it is quite evident from the MANY (not all, if you have a cat that is happy indoors and you want to tell me about it in the comments I won't find that sufficiently convincing) indoor cats zooming for the door or staring out the window that an indoor only life isn't sufficient. This is also supported by research on domestic cat territory sizes. Even in studies with smaller observed territory sizes, it is sufficiently more than a standard sized home. 

Keeping a cat purely indoors is an antiquated pet ownership practice and I think people do mental gymnastics to support it. Ultimately we use an inflated metric of "life" in service of actions that harm our pets. I truly believe that ethical cat ownership requires either a leash trained cat or a large outdoor enclosure.

I find that the extreme defensiveness of many cat owners on this subject just further solidifies my belief. Would love to hear some non- defensive takedowns of my opinion.
