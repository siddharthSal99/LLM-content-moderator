Title: CMV: Teenagers / “older kids” should be allowed to trick-or-treat without judgment 
Post Text: Whenever it comes to trick-or-treat and Halloween I always seem to hear adults telling older kids “aren’t you a little old to be trick-or-treating?” And get the vibe that a decent amount of people feel “teenagers” shouldn’t be going door to door asking for candy. 

Why?  What age range is it ok then? 

In a world where we beg to “let kids be kids” why is a 14 even 17 year old not yet adult is given grief when dressing up, enjoying the outdoors, spending time with friends or family or even alone and getting free candy? 

Isn’t this better than many other possibly delinquent activities they could be doing? Is it too naïve to think that kids who are out causing trouble might be less inclined to smash pumpkins if they didn’t feel it was “uncool” to trick-or-treat and felt more welcomed to participate?

Some kids that appear old as well may just look older, may be developmentally delayed, may not have other friends or family to hang out with that night and this is an activity they can participate in and enjoy but then they hear “you look a little old….” 

Curious peoples thoughts / CMV

ETA: agreed with multiple comments a costume is a “requirement” for inclusion of older kids and giving of candy
