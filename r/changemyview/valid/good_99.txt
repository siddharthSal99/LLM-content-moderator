Title: CMV: Christianity is worse than scientology 
Post Text: Advocates for Christianity and Islam alike; and to a lesser extent detractors thereof; single out scientology as the worst of religions for its allegedly cult-like methods for making people stay. One can avoid the ill effects of this by not joining in the first place.

There is less avoiding the ill effects of Christianity. *Most* of the *important* ones can be attributable "either to Christianity or to conservatism", but of all the ill effects, one stands out to me that cannot be attributable primarily to conservatism; its opposition to embryonic stem cell research (ESCR), and the diseases and disabilities that could have been cured if Christianity hadn't gotten in the way.

&amp;#x200B;

There are three schools of thought of which I am familiar thus far on this one.

&amp;#x200B;

The first is to say that ESCR is murder, in which case the morning-after pill is murder, since it kills a zygote comparably far along. You could argue self-defense in the latter in lieu of zygote insentience, but I cannot think of any other context in which "self-defense" is argued for against (to those who see zygotes as persons) a child, who is not aware they are the aggressor nor were deliberately being so. We outlaw warning shots because the life of an innocent bystander is worth so much more than the life of the aggressor that you cannot put the latter in the slightest danger to spare the former. I'm not sure why intent of the aggressors and bystander are so much more relevant than that of the zygote. It's also worth noting that respondents claim not to consider ESCR murder ***anyway***, but that alone doesn't tell us they mean that, much less explain why they don't as vocally or passionately oppose the characterization thereof as murder like they do for the characterization of the morning-after pill as murder.

The second is to say that they are allowed to do said research, just not with others' tax dollars. But we all have to fund things we disagree with. The education system's curriculum is answerable only to 51% of voters, not 100%. Many military operations are controversial yet we don't have to stop just because some people object. Making this a private service would render it almost pointless, as any cures that get in the way of making money off treatments could be concealed. Only making it a public service would **require** enough transparency on how it's carried out to prevent that from happening. If your idea of a "compromise" plays into companies' hands, it's a compromise worth re-evaluating.

&amp;#x200B;

The third is to say that this is yet another thing to blame on conservatives, not Christianity. I hope they're right, as I've gotten along well with progressive Christians in multiple jobs over the years. But there's also no denying that progressives have let this issue fade from the spotlight. From what I've heard, they spent 2004 howling from the rooftops about Dubya throwing away excess embryos that could've saved lives. Then over the years stopped talking about it. This should be something people are following up on every day. What progress has been made? What are scientists doing with that money? Sam Harris, often regarded by mainstream progressives as a conservative, spoke glowingly of ESCR as a "moral issue science has solved." I don't agree with that *specific* line of reasoning; science is about positive statements, morality about normative statements. They're too distinct for one to inherently address the other. But that's a much more vocal defense of ESCR than any I've heard any comparably mainstream leftist make in the past few years. Why is that? And why, if progressive Christians think you don't get to call yourself pro-life unless you support spending tax dollars on school lunch programs or the like, do they not get to call themselves pro-life unless they support spending tax dollars on research that could save lives?
