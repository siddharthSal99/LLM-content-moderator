Title: CMV: it's rude to call someone instead of replying to a business email 
Post Text: I (as I'm sure everyone else does too), send and receive an incredibly large volume of emails...like... a lot of emails.... thousands per day type thing. I also need to keep incredibly good documentation of responses etc. as part of my job. When I send an email with direct questions, sometimes folks will call me on the phone when they read the email. This grinds my gears because a) I don't have time to have a phone conversation 99% of the time and b) then I have to reply to my own email with a thread like, "as per our phone conversation, this is what you told me...etc." for documentation. I get the desire to explain over the phone in case tone is misconstrued, but it makes more work for me. Can anyone please try to convince me that a call is better than an email in this situation?
