Title: CMV: “A Bridge too Far” has the Best Cast of Any Movie Ever Made 
Post Text: For the sake of this discussion, I am defining the “best cast” as the largest collection of great actors who all starred in the same film.  It’s not about the specific film, but rather the combined acting careers of everyone who appeared in a given film.  The movie itself can be terrible for all I care.

Most movies have one or two, maybe three major stars in them.  Or one big star and a few lesser well known actors.

Let’s list out the stars of A Bridge too Far (1977)

Directed by: Richard Attenborough 

Starring

* Sean Connery
* Michael Caine
* James Caan
* Anthony Hopkins
* Gene Hackman
* Laurence Olivier 
* Robert Redford
* Liv Ullmann 

And that’s just the top tier of actors.  Then you add in all the supporting roles like

* Elliot Gould
* Denholm Eillot
* John Ratzenberger

All actors most Americans would recognize almost 45 years later, all who had a long and amazing career in acting.  

To CMV, simply list a better movie with a larger collection of long term stars.  By my count it should have at least seven major stars,  three secondary stars, and a famous director.  They should be famous for more than just the one movie.
