Title: CMV: The “satisfaction of completing a hard task” is nonsense 
Post Text: Some people say that one of the good things about doing hard things is the satisfaction you get after completing them.

But sometimes after I complete a hard task I don’t feel any satisfaction, the only thing I’ll feel is the need to cool down for a bit. There’s really no satisfaction, just plain exhaustion, perhaps mentally, perhaps physically.

When I finish a very hard homework or a very long project, if it’s a hard assignment in a course I’m interested in I feel this a little less, but for courses I don’t like, after finishing a particularly hard assignment, I don’t feel satisfied at all. I just feel completely exhausted. Just no satisfaction whatsoever. And to go and see all those people talk about “the satisfaction of completing a challenging task” kind of stings a bit. I mean, you’ve worked your but off and you want to celebrate rather than take a break. Sounds a little nonsensical to me. So why do people think this? For me it’s probably more that I’m so exhausted I kind of don’t have the mood to feel satisfied.
