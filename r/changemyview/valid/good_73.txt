Title: CMV: it wouldn't be a bad world if we were to all think the same 
Post Text: I am worried at heart I am no different to the fanatical control freaks (the Klaus Schwabs of the world) who foisted diabolical lockdowns on us over the last three years. These individuals are the kind who see the world as 'out of control', but the problem is, I realise I too, seem to be of this mindset. I find the world an enormously disconcerting, overwhelming, confusing place, in relation to the fact that so many of us (myself included) are born with 'infringements' such as Autism, Bipolar Disorder or (to a more extreme extent) Schizophrenia. Those of us in the Autism Spectrum definitely have our brains wired differently, at times it can feel almost like this to a radical extent; we have a different way of formulating things in our head, social cues we struggle with, and we are vulnerable to what one would call 'sensory overload', a problem that doesn't really affect 'neurotypicals' in the same way. Now, we hear that having these individuals in society (myself included) is positive because if we were 'all the same, it would be boring', but seriously why would that be a bad thing. A lot of inventors/innovators have been Autistic, but a lot HAVEN'T as well, and they only represent a tiny % of the population. I can't detract the thought that Autism is just a primarilily 'inbred' trait, that has survived in the human gene pool because our ancestors were too f\*\*\*ing selfish to just resign themselves from the gene pool. It is an unfair roll of the dice that so many who are born with these traits are consigned to a life that is stressful and lonely. I also feel that at the end of the day, we are an absolute burden on society; think of how annoying it is to have a % of the population that will just get 'wound up' in a social setting, annoying everyone else around them. In other words, I can't get my head around the 'chaos', and that why we are all not just born with similar mindsets/mental faculties.
