Title: CMV: NFL goalposts should be taller 
Post Text: Sometimes a field goal goes ambiguously over the top of the upright. Some of these look really tough or impossible to call. Why not extent the goalposts another ~20 feet vertically? You can’t tell me this is structurally unsound (or maybe you can?). No way can the refs tell every time. Some kicks would have hit the post if it was taller. Now you have a ref guessing on whether or not a ball would have ricocheted right or left off a hypothetical pole. 

A high-dollar organization like the NFL can figure out the construction logistics. Humans have been to *space*, so we can make a tall, safe goalpost. A laser shining out the top is no good, because we still need to know if the kick would have hit the pole and gone in or out. The only way is more pipe extending further into the sky.

What might CMV? I honestly don’t know. I feel like this argument is unassailable. But please tell me why I’m wrong. I’m definitely open to CMV, but I can’t picture yet what that would take.
