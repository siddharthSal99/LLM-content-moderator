Title: CMV: K9 police dogs are immoral and should be abolished 
Post Text: Change my view. K9 police dogs are immoral. For the animals and for the people that are targeted. 

Many dogs are killed by police officers’ negligence. They get left in hot cars to die.  They are also put in dangerous situations where they can be killed by who the police are targeting. Training an animal as a weapon against humans is immoral. 

These dogs are also used in situations where it is unnecessary. Many unarmed people are mauled. Non violent offenders are mauled. POC are disproportionately targets of of dog attacks administered by police. 

The attacks can permanently disfigure the person being attacked. It’s cruel and unusual punishment, and these people haven’t even had a trial.
