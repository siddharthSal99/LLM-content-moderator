Title: CMV: For someone with Cerebral Palsy it's too late to try and start a career at the age of 37. 
Post Text: 
This is a little self-serving but I genuinely believe this and would really like my view changed. 
 
I was born with Cerebral Palsy, a disability that effects my speech, my walking and my stability. I started taking baby steps around 7-yo and only around 26-yo I felt I was making improvements.

I went to highschool, college and university like a drone, most likely I was depressed. By the time I grauated university at 23-yo (computer science) I felt in the brink of exgastion. I felt depressed, weak, and honestly knew deep in my soul that trying to get a job would be harmful for me. 

I became recluse, but thankfully in the dark tunel I was in, there was a small light, that made me get up in the morning and go to the gym. And eventually happiness grew. 

Mentally I've come 80% on the otherside, now I believe that my value is not based on what I contribute in the world - in fact, human value I believe is a myth. Whether you are steve jobs or a homeless person, you are equally valueless.

**Now I am in a great place**, slightly scared that the other shoe might drop but, though a loner, broke, "valueless" by some form of social standards. I feel amazing 

To get a job as a programmer you need:

- to know programming - for at least entry level, I have that (current skills checked)
- communication skills - I have a speech difficulty (some same writen communication counts, I don't believe them)
- work experience - I'm 37 never had a job
- education - an old CS degree that's over 10 years old

**Being blunt**, I get state benefits because I'm dissabled, I think it's better to not even try going through job search as everything is stacked against me 

- huge gap
- old cv
- old age
- would be useless to speak over the phone
- face-to-face interviews might be hard due to emotions.

Since I've found my comfort zone and I'm happy, I feel everything is stacked in a way that if I go out and find a job, my life would get fucked up: Even if I get some job, I have all this time with minimal human interaction. I will do a shit job at interaction and team work, get fired, maybe by benefits would be taken away from me...

I tried to be as open as possible in hopes that though it sounds I'm just "lazy living of off benefits" it's really not the case
