Title: CMV: Leaving a relationship which has minor children involved for the reason, "I'm just not happy" is not a valid moral reason for leaving a relationship/divorce. 
Post Text: EDIT: if this changes your perception of me, I don't plan on ever getting married or having kids, in part because I value myself over the "water" kids bring to my port and the risk involved if marriages go south and the harm such would cause to potential children with the current divorce rate being what it is. At least I'm consistent. I don't think its a good deal for me, so I don't make the deal, which has been my appeal throughout! I'm also not religious, just for context. 

For clarity: In abuse, certainly valid moral reason to leave. I could see cheating which is persistent and pernicious to also be a valid reason. I can see various other reasons like criminal behavior, drug abuse, refusing to work and pull one's weight, child neglect, etc. also being more than valid. Additionally, due to reduced harms, after the kids are 18 the "I'm just not happy" reason is allowed. **Again, it's only when you are in a relationship with kids under the roof.**

However, simply because one "isn't happy" or one doesn't have the "excitement" or other such personal pleasure reasons is not a valid moral reason to break up a relationship with children involved.

Reasons:

1) Single parent households lead to dramatically worse outcomes (on average) for the children. In terms on future income, in terms of crime rates, in terms of mental/emotional troubles, etc. Your own happiness is clearly counter-balanced by the negative impacts on the children. The children count for just as much as you. Is your momentary happiness worth more than the life-time of impacts such would have on the children? I think not. When you have a kid you have a duty to do the best for them, not a duty to do best for you!

2) Represents a re-neg on one's commitment for the relationship. One can't re-write the terms of a bargain simply because one isn't happy. Does this mean that a couple shouldn't work out its problems, of course not, however, breaking up a relationship simply out of a lack of personal pleasure was never the deal that marriage or long-term relationships propose (we even say in vows, "for better or worse"). Rather, such is a deal based around duty and providing children a starting point for their future life.

3) One's happiness is one's own responsibility. Making one's partner the external source for one's own happiness isn't fair to the partner.

4) Breaking up relationships for personal happiness reasons encourages and validates long-term relationships (with children) and Marriages being transitory and erodes their meaning. It devalues commitment and trust, because at any moment if partner isn't happy it becomes morally acceptable to break up the family, harm the kids, harm the financial situation, etc. Therefore, eliminating mere personal happiness from the equation strengthens the meaning of commitment and encourages families to work out their problems and encourages deeper thinking before making long-term commitments in relationships. It also sets example for kids that if one does want to have kids with someone they had better work on that relationship and think deeply, as they simply can't re-neg if they "don't like it" 7 years down the line. 

5) Validating leaving for simple happiness sends bad messages to society and children about relationships. It forces one into a self-centered hedonistic view of relationships where only the individual counts and not the other people who are impacted in the relationship.

6) Increases financial family stability as well as financial opportunity for children. It also increases the amount of time parents can spend with their children due to being a two income household as opposed to a single parent one. 

7) Gives children safety and security and trust that mom and dad will both be there after school. 

8) Allows for same gender role-models to be there at all times for the children. Which is also important.

Delta will be given if one can produce a reason for someone to break up a relationship simply out of personal pleasure that does NOT involve:
Abuse, child neglect, criminal behavior, drug abuse, negative financial situations (ex. scum-bag don't want to work and sits home all day and does nothing... which would probably be financial abuse!), cheating, etc...

Again, for me to change my mind here I need clear argument for why my personal pleasure or dissatisfaction alone is enough to break up a relationship with children involved.
