Title: CMV: just because something is legal/normal doesn't make it moral 
Post Text: This has to do with laws in general but the example is more specific to things like abortion, alcohol usage, and bringing kids to protests. 

Basically all these things have a strong sense of immorality/hipocracy about them (alcohol is harmful in any quantity like smoking or doing heroin but it is legal and therefore people criticize you for opposing it, abortion is legal because of a mother's right to choose but they also don't want to acknowledge the fact that they are killing a child, and bringing kids to protests is legal but a child doesn't have the ability to comprehend the reasons for supporting a protest so they illegitimize the movement.)
