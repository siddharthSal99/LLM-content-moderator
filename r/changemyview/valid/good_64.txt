Title: CMV: Too much racial awareness makes racism worse. 
Post Text: There seems to be an ever increasing focus on inequities stemming from race and systemic racism. And the focus seems to be ever louder and ever present. I'm talking about workplace implicit bias testing, social movements (like Black Lives Matter), diversity initiatives, the politics of immigration, etc. Each of which I have supported, and all of which seem important for change.

But I had a realization recently. I think it passed some kind of a tipping point at some time. Somewhere along the way, race has moved too far into the forefront of my consciousness. It's gotten to a level where a persons race dominates my awareness throughout an interaction. It's become too much of a focus, when of course there is so much more to a person than some amalgamated racial milieu of experiences based on the color of their skin.

I think some people would look at this and say that's the point. But I just want to go back to seeing people as people, and let the racial awareness become secondary.

I'd have to imagine that other people will have developed this same type of hyper focus too. But for people who make negative race-based assumptions, this will augment racist tendencies and worsen race relations.

Edit: A lot of points from different ends of the spectrum here. I appreciate everyone's comments although I can't reply to all of them. I definitely have a more well-rounded understanding of the topic and different people's experiences with it.
