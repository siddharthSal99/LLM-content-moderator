Title: CMV: Corporal punishment isn't as bad as people make it out to be 
Post Text: Alright, title is pretty baity so let me explain.

I'm a 24M from the bible belt of America (the south). First off, I'd like to begin with the fact that I've done little research on this topic. My view/opinion is strictly from being raised in the bible belt / southern U.S. and my experience as well as the opinion and experiences of my peers. Call it indoctrination, call it geographical/cultural relativism. Call it whatever you want. I'm just giving you the backstory for the opinion alright?

Anyways, I was raised by a loving and excellent mother and father. Love them to death and are excellent parents to this day and I have always had a great relationship with them.  But, just because they were loving, doesn't mean they weren't strict. I got spanked from about 5 years old till the age of 13 from my parents and got paddled in school until ninth grade. 

I was disciplined for many things and I'll name a few:

If I got paddled at school that always meant I would get spanked when I got home. If I wanted to act an ass at school then I would pay the price at school and pay double at home. Learned to stop showing my ass in public. I was still allowed to be myself and be a kid, but you learn to stop doing the things you obviously aren't supposed to do.

If I had anything less than a B on my report card then I would get spanked. My father knew that I had potential academically and didn't settle for mediocrity and wasting that potential. Learned to apply myself in school and was high honor roll from 3rd - 12'th grade. 

If I directly disobeyed my parents orders, and that resulted in something that warranted more than a timeout/grounding, I would get spanked. If my parents told me to go to bed at 9, and caught me awake at 9:30 then they wouldn't spank me obviously. But if they told me "don't play with fire" and then I caught something valuable on fire, then I'd get spanked. Learned to respect authority and there's probably a reason they tell me these things and they aren't doing it to "just be mean" like all kids think. 

If I was ever a bully to another kid or purposely caused physical harm to anyone for any reason except self defense, I got spanked. Learned that it doesn't feel good to get hurt, so stopped hurting other people.

I got paddled and whooped for a lot of things, but never got one I didn't deserve.

Here's my point. I was raised this way and so was quite literally everyone I know. And we all turned out perfectly fine. Well, as fine as anyone can be I reckon. Obviously I'm not saying corporal punishment turned us into perfect role model citizens but everyone turned out alright in the grand scheme of things. And, in my uneducated opinion, turned out better than most people who didn't receive corporal punishment growing up. 

You can always tell which kids get properly disciplined and which one's don't. If you can't tell when they're kids then you can almost always tell when they are adults. Kids that get disciplined show respect, act as kids should without being literal devils, you're fine with being around them, etc. Kids that don't get disciplined show no respect, cuss out teachers, you can't wait to get away from the kid, etc. Obviously there are exceptions to every case. I'm not saying that getting spanked turns everyone into a perfect person; and I'm not saying that kids who don't get disciplined have no hope and will be dredges of society. I'm not saying that at all. But, what I am saying, is you can almost always tell which kids get disciplined and which ones don't. And I'm willing to bet you'd rather be around the kids that do than the kids that don't. 

How is grounding or a timeout or something like that a proper punishment for bullying? How is it a proper punishment for hurting someone physically or emotionally? If you had told 8 year old me that I could keep throwing mulch at people on the playground, and the only punishment was a pussy ass time out, I never would have stopped throwing mulch. 

So why is there such a negative stigma around it? It was a form of discipline for a majority of civilized human history and only recently has it basically become non-existent. If it didn't work I'm sure we would've stopped it many many years ago. I really don't care what John Doe at Dicknuts University has to say in his case study or whatever. No case study in the history of this has ever effected anyone I've known, anyone I do know, or anyone I will know. This is something I personally believe a case study can't describe or "fix". If a kid got whooped and grew up to be a school shooter... I'm willing to bet he was fucked from the start. The discipline along the way didn't make him evil. He was probably evil or misunderstood from the jump. It's the way life has always worked and always will work. There's good people, and there's not so good people. I doubt a spanking as a kid was the straw that broke the camels back I mean let's just be realistic. 

Side note: Obviously if someone who is a hateful piece of shit is just hitting their kid to hit their kid then that's something completely different. That's evil. I'm not talking about evil. I'm talking about disciplining with good intentions and doing it so your kids will realize their mistakes and become a better person.
