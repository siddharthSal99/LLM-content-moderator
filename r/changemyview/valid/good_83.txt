Title: CMV: Liberals/Lefties should hold their nose and buy guns - US Specific 
Post Text: Edit:

**I live in Maine. There is an active shooter on the lamb, undoubtedly another right wing terrorist.

To everyone who told me to touch grass, thanks. I will. But I'll wait until it's safe to leave my house.**

I've seen a couple of news articles lately about how support for political violence is on the rise.

After the events in the US, I am sad to say, that I think it's time for we liberals to play realpolitik for the time being on the issue of gun ownership.

With the rise in mass shootings, partisan violence, insurrection by right wing mobs, coup attempts, and paramilitary groups like The Proud Boys; we need to get real.

There are millions of Americans who want us dead. They don't believe in the rule of law or democracy. They will cheat, intimidate, or even kill to get their way. And they're heavily armed.

With the absolute gridlock in politics, there is zero chance we will be able to get laws on the books to limit gun ownership. We don't even have a speaker of the house. Even if we did, there are so many unregistered/stolen/claimed lost or destroyed weapons out there, that its impossible to disarm the crazies. 

While we sit and debate policy and put up a few token and ineffectual protests here and there, they are working tirelessly to steal elections, take away our rights, and dismantle our institutions. They are playing for keeps. Every day, they become more emboldened, to the point where their leading presidential candidate advocates for shooting shoplifters, executing top generals, jailing the opposition, etc. 

They celebrated the assault on Paul Pelosi. They run over protestors. They're abusing immigrants. They're buying and training with deadly assault weapons.

So, change my view that we on the left should be buying and training with our own weapons. Please note, this isn't to defend against the US military, it's to defend ourselves from treasonous mobs and make the terrorists think twice about acting with impunity as to how it affects our health/safety/well being/ability to organize.
