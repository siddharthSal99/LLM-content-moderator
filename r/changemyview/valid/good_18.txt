Title: CMV: Political Campaign Statements should not be allowed to attack political opponents on anything that is neither a publicly searchable confirmed record, nor a cleanly stated campaign statement 
Post Text: It's no secret that current politics is a crap show, no matter what side of the aisle you are on.

While I don't think that stunting relevant statements during a political campaign should be automatic, it should be punishable via libel/slander suits to attack someone with undemonstrated/unproven statements, and political campaign statements should not be immune to those kinds of defamatory lawsuits.

Example #1 being: I do not think that putting out an attack ad stating "Politician A is a pedophile" should be exempt from a slander suit just because it's a political campaign statement, even though Politician A was never indicted, sued or convicted of being one, and never said as a public-facing statement that they were one.

The main problem with this, is logical conclusions from statements, which is a grey area that I believe should be fine to see protected, so long as they are logically consistent with stated claims, or already demonstrated/proven facts.

Example #2 being: If Politician A says that age of consent should be lowered to 10 years old, it would fall into logical conclusions that they may be interested in pedophilia, or trying to protect pedophiles from legal issues, and stating "Politician A wants to lower the age of consent to 10 years old, almost like he's a pedophile just trying to make it legal", shouldn't be libelous/slanderous.

As a flip example #3, however, taking the same idea: If Politician A says that age of consent should be lowered to 10 years old", it also shouldn't be correct to then claim that "Politician A wants to kidnap and kill 10 year old kids in his back shed". This does not flow naturally from the claim, and shouldn't be immune from slander lawsuit.

I already see that one coming, though... That one line...

&gt; Where is the line?

The line is on whether or not someone logical could come to the same conclusion, without having to add other unproven elements. Example #3 needs to add the unproven murderous intent, for instance.

Applying this could lead to a healthier "here is my actual plan" type of politics, and less of a "he's a satanic worshipper who drinks toddler blood to summon Lucifer" politics.

EDIT: I am now fully convinced that another heavily misunderstood facet of the justice system is the system by which slander/libel laws are brought up, as it not a prosecutor raising the charges, but someone drawing you in court for damages and compensations based on the unfair statements you've made. This is, as such, not an attack on free speech.

Likewise, it seems like people keep misunderstanding what I meant by a "demonstrable fact". If you point out that an opponent has been giving lots of money to an interests group that is against the interests you defend, that's a fact, but you don't get to make up a whole demonization process that doesn't naturally flow from that. Likewise, you can 100% show that an opponent has been silent on an issue, but that doesn't mean you get to invent them a deeply criminal history because of it.

The entire point of normalizing such slander lawsuits, and reducing the standards of evidence in these for politcal speech, is to bring politics to be less about how other politicians are bad, and more about how you are a good choice, and pulling the whole system away from "I am the least bad option", in favor of "I actually am a good option".
