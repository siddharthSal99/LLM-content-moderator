Title: CMV: There is nothing after death 
Post Text: I believe after you die there is nothing for you, as an athiest I only believe in what has been proven fact and frankly I don't think there will be an afterlife for any of us.
I mean we're all just electrical signals that's our memories and personalities it's all we are, so once those die and are lost we're gone there is no afterlife for us because how will we experience it our brains are gone.
Ever since a kid I never really actually believed there was a specific afterlife it was always just we don't know but I feel like I'm right about this but we don't want to share this infact I didn't want to share this belief in case it would make other people sad.
I don't think any religious belief will make me think differently I mean I'll only believe it if it's proven true or a strong scientific theory.
I gonan write some more to make sure it gets to 500 characters just in case, I really hate how horrible of a belief it is and I really want it to be changed.
Thank you.



I already have my view changed commenting is a waste of time.
