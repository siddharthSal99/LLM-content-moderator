Title: CMV:Representative Bowman's fine should be more like $100 
Post Text: Representative Bowman had a door he prefers to exit through, and when it was unexpectedly locked, he falsely pulled a fire alarm thinking it would unlock that door.  He is being fined $1000.

$1000 seems too high for such a misdeed.  Fines should be as low as possible while still deterring bad behavior, and pulling fire alarms in Congress is super uncommon.  This is happening way less often than once a year, which I'd consider an acceptable rate, so the fine should be lowered.  

I understand that this may be a bigger problem in schools, so I don't have a problem keeping the fine high in schools, but outside that special case, we should lower the fine.  I think $100 would be an adequate deterrent.
