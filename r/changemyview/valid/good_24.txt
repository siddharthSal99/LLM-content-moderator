Title: CMV: Reddit is not as toxic as people make it out to be 
Post Text: There has always been a view about how reddit is so toxic and people are just looking for a fight etc. I feel this is for the most part, a bad generalization. What makes reddit do good is that you get so many conflicting viewpoints that on one particular topic of discussion, as a bystander, you would be able to see through almost all of the perspectives possible. And when you put forth an opinion of your own, you can bet your bottom dollar that someone has a really good argument against it in the most logical way. This nog only forces you to think, but also humbles you. I am sure there would be someone who contradicts my thoughts here with relevant logic but that would just be proving my point and that's the best part about it
