Title: CMV: Tipping should be illegal. 
Post Text: Customers pay for a product, employers pay for labour, and employees pay with time for money. That is the trifecta, that is how it has always been in everything every since the beginning of time. 

Now with tipping becoming all the fucking rage, you got employers skimping on their responsibilities of paying for labour and pushing it onto the customers. And we as a society encourage this and give people who don't tip a nasty look. 

What is wrong with us as a society. 

Now we got employees paying with time for labour, customers paying for food and labour, and already filthy rich corporations doing the money dance because now they don't even have to pay labour (which in general is already barely peanuts all across the board). And the more as a society we keep building the social pressure to tip, the more corporations can get away with paying less. Thats why it should be fucking illegal to accept tips, fuck the corporations make them pay reasonable wages. 

Frankly its not our responsibility to pay for labour. If your boss is giving you a shit wage, that is between you and your boss. I as the customer am not responsible for this shit. MAYBE a little tip if you're EXTRA EXTRA good at your customer service. But why do I  get a gross look if I don't give the pizza guy money just for doing his job and driving my delivery here. 

And why are just SOME things tipped. Why servers but not cashiers. It doesn't make fucking sense right? 

Make that shit illegal. Stop the peer pressure to tip. Stop making customers feel bad for not tipping. Be mad at your boss. Put pressure on your boss. Put the pressure where it belongs. When you pressure the customers and consumers to tip, and we as a society do this, you just give corporations all the more leverage. Fuck tipping.
