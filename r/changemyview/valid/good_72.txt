Title: CMV: American news media is committing an abdication of duty every time they refer to Trump (or others') lies as "false claims" or similar 
Post Text: Inspired most immediately by [this headline](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-false-claims-new-hampshire_n_6536e24fe4b011a9cf7ab60f), but this has been going on for years. 

Trump lies, constantly. This is common knowledge. But you wouldn't really know it by reading mainstream media coverage. They're typically very careful to refer to his lies as "misstatements" or "false claims" or similar. I remember the leadup to the 2016 election included a number of hand-wringing, pearl-clutching op-eds about why the various institutions were so careful not to use the word "lie", and most of them actually included some warning that if Trump couldn't figure out how to stop lying so much, they might even start using the word. But since then I've seen little evidence that media companies are willing to refer to his many obvious lies as lies. All this despite being close to a decade in of Trump being an active political player, including four years in the white house. 

In fact, I think many media outlets are exacerbating the problem by their careful framing of his lies - more often than not, I see a headline that simply repeats the lie Trump told, and then includes as a byline (or buried later in the article) a refutation of the statement. But IMO the damage is already done: there is now a giant headline that simply repeats Trump's lie. Many people who read the lie will not go on to read about how the lie is false. 

I know media companies are driven by profit more than truth, so my argument here is really just based on a commonly-held narrative about what a journalist's job *should* be. Obviously that's up for some debate, but I think most reasonable people can agree that a journalist's job essentially involves sharing accurate information with people. Which would include referring to Trump's many and obvious lies as what they are, instead of coddling him and giving him the benefit of the doubt time after time. 

The most obvious argument against using "lie" in this context I think comes from the fact that Trump has never/rarely been proven in criminal court to be knowingly lying about something. But this is a very strict standard that, while it may make sense in a legal context, is very specifically NOT what journalists should be bound to. Journalists should be acting completely independently of the legal system, and should be willing to call lies what they are.
