Title: CMV: If Jesus came back today, the majority of Christians would not recognize him for who he was. 
Post Text: I want to preface this by saying that I am not sure whether the historical Jesus existed or not, and that I am not a Christian and therefore do not believe that Jesus was the son of God.

However, based on the Biblical story of Jesus, he was an Israeli who spoke Aramaic, and possibly also Hebrew and Greek. He almost definitely wasn't white and he certainly didn't speak English. English did not exist when Jesus was alive. He never had a passport (those didn't exist either), nor do his fingerprints or DNA exist in any database.

Now imagine you are an ICE agent, and there is a 33 year old Middle Eastern man who has no documents of any kind, no birth certificate, ID, passport, visa, nothing... whose fingerprints are not in any database on Earth, and of whom no prior record, criminal or otherwise, exists in any country.

Would you believe this man when he says (through a translator, if one is available) that he is the second coming of Jesus? And even if you did believe him... would you allow him to remain in the country, given that he has no documents?

Even if by some miracle he managed to get through immigration in whatever country he came back to... who among us would believe that this man is really Jesus? I wouldn't, though like I said, I don't really believe in Jesus to begin with.

How do we know he isn't on Earth today, locked up in a high-security prison like Guantanamo, being held indefinitely until the government can figure out who he is and where he came from?
