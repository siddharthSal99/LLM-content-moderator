Title: cmv: if you aren't required to have an expensive college degree for your occupational license you should avoid going to an expensive college. 
Post Text: for example of why some people must go to expensive universities, you cannot get a license to practice medicine without a medical degree from a college. you cannot legally practice some medicine without such a degree. practicing law is another case where you must have a degree to practice with rare exceptions. civil engineers also need an expensive university education by law.

there are some benefits to going to college for other occupations that universities will accentuate in their sales pitches but the reality is that you can get most of those benefits to a much greater degree with other methods of training and education outside of expensive colleges and universities.

i specify "expensive" colleges because cheaper technical colleges often have very efficient training programs that you can complete in a year (vs 2 to 6). the reason they can be so efficient is because they don't have all the expensive bureaucracy and they don't get involved in time-consuming publishing and expensive research. the instructors in technical colleges always have practical experience and are often accomplished in their fields and actually want to be training people in those fields which is the exact opposite of what happens in expensive universities where professors must teach in order to keep their university research jobs.

beyond all of that, colleges have become institutions of government propaganda and toxic woke indoctrination that does the opposite of preparing students for success and independent thought.

to change my view you might show me how the benefits of expensive college are worth the cost versus the alternatives.
