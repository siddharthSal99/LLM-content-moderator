Title: CMV: psychopaths are just people who refuse to wear social masks 
Post Text: I believe that the world is full of people that would be considered deranged crazy psychos, but these individuals restrain themselves to act as such only out of (reasonable) fear of the repercussions.

The so called mental illness is more a matter of self control. Being "crazy" is the standard, whereas being "normal" is a pondered decision to act according to social norms. 

In the past the stigma of craziness was meant to discourage certain behaviors, now it has become more of an alibi to escape repobsabilities and in some cases it is even glamourized.

"Craziness" is part of human nature and society is a construct that goes against it. But in the evaluation of pros and cons, it is better to give up the first rather than the second. 

I'm not saying such behaviours have to be promoted, but they should simply be honestly acknowledged for what they really are and not alienated from ourselves.
