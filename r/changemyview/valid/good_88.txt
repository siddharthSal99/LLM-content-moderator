Title: CMV: Summer is the worst season 
Post Text: Please note: I am making this argument in the context of regions where there is a significant enough difference between the seasons.

Summer is the worst season.

Why? Let's start off with the obvious: heat. As the climate warms, summers are getting increasingly hot. Hot temperatures make it unpleasant to be outside, especially if you have to do any strenuous physical activity like working or working out. If your only option is to work or workout outside, you're at an increased risk of heat related afflictions like heatstroke, heat stress, and heat exhaustion. As temperatures increase, wet bulb events become more likely - potentially impacting the lives of millions around the world. Speaking of health risks, you'll also have to worry about sunburns more over the summer than the rest of the year. High temperatures don't just impact people, though. Pets risk burning their paws on hot pavement, wild animals are exhausted, and even machines struggle to keep cool enough to remain operational. Extremely high temperatures in the summer can't easily be avoided in the same way that extremely low temperatures in the winter can - if you don't have the right equipment (notably A/C or alternative climate control system), staying cool can be a real challenge. 

High temperatures also increase the risk of natural disasters like wildfires. Wildfires not only put people, pets, and property into risky scenarios, but also pollute the air for millions further from the site of the fire. It's becoming increasingly common to experience prolonged periods of poor air quality over the summer. Bad air quality doesn't just hurt your lungs, it also makes it thoroughly unpleasant to be outside. Going on a hike? Your chest is going to hurt, eyes are going to water, and you won't be able to see clearly beyond a few hundred meters.

While extreme heat is the main problem with summer, I also have several minor grievances:

1. Summer is tourist season. While tourists can play an important part in the local economy, they're also a major pain in the ass to deal with. Everything gets busier, things tend to be more expensive, and infrastructure like roads get congested. Tourism in the slower seasons has a much less pronounced impact on my life. 

2. Insects. Summer is prime time for bugs like bedbugs (thanks in part to tourism), ticks, and mosquitos. These bugs can cause major health problems like yellow fever, Lyme disease, etc. 

3. Kids are out of school. This is a headache for working parents who either have to take time off or organize childcare. Others may find it annoying to deal with significantly more children in public spaces.

What will change my view: 

Demonstrate that another season is worse than summer.
