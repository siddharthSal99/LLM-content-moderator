Title: CMV: Sexuality has become confusing because of American standards around adhering to biblical principles 
Post Text: I've been a victim myself of adhering to gender norms in America, due to my environment promoting the glory of the "body count" with regards to men's method to identity "man amongsts men". I state though that sexuality tends to be confusing due to a belief that "God" wants us to be wives to men and husband to women &lt;- note the plurality in that statement.

My earliest childhood memory has a belief that God wants us to procreate man and woman and that is the purpose of our sexual expression - and that sexual expression without the intent to practice co-creation is flawed: i.e. gay sex, masturbation, and all types of sex that doesn't revolve around the ritual of co-creating life.

I personally believe that the need for a nation to create humans create a natural force...a pressure... that forces us to adhere to heterosexual normatively, and that we opt out unconsciously from exploring our sexuality early due to the need for our supergo to feel safe within societal expectations.

My statement of "sexuality becoming confusing" is because I see people, including myself, trying to break away from boxes yet find ourselves in a wider box, only to one day find ourselves having to fight to be free from that wider box one day - in my opinion.

My statement of "because of American standards" is because we use english words that are defined predominately in the American mindset

and my statement of "...around adhering to biblical principles" is because I see we're often times attempting to avoid "hell" and "God's lack of love" when exporing our own sexuality.

I'm curious if sexuality is confusing because of this, or if I've narrowed my scope to think it's only an "American attempt at adhering to the Bible" when the confusion has been proven or seen to be much grander than that.
