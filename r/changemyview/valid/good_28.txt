Title: CMV: Hunting for food is the most ethical means of eating meat 
Post Text: Ethically eating any meat is probably a negative but my perspective is that to live is to be destructive in some means, net zero living is impractical as a modern human unless you live like a caveman in which case your lifespan probably won't be very long.

The solution I feel to the ethical dilemma of meat, if you care enough to think about it, is hunting. It's no secret factory farms are pretty horrible, lifestock is raised in a cage, pumped full of steroids and slaughtered to mention the least of it. 

Personally I'm not against eating supermarket meat, I don't care enough to change my diet, but I would far rather kill an animal in the wild that has lived a good life over one that has lived in captivity. 

That's just my two cents, I am extremely pro ethical hunting for food or pest control, but I welcome people to change my mind on this.
