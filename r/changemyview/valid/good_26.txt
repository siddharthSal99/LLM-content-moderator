Title: CMV: Israel is to blamed for hamas' terrorist activities 
Post Text: Let's just keep hamas aside for a second, and talk about the west bank where there is no hamas. 

ISREAL IS BUILDING SETTLEMENTS AGAINST INTERNATIONAL LAWS

The territory for Palestine and Israel is defined in the international laws, however Israel have taking more land, and is expanding its territory.

PALESTINIANS DON'T WANT FUNDINGS, THEY WANT THEIR RIGHTS

Palestinians don't have the right to travel freely, they don't have protection and Israeli gov controls everything. 

Before, the recent events, Israel continuously harassed, deported, detained and killed Palestinians EVERY WEEK. They even killed a journalist (Shireen Abu Akleh) and then attacked her funeral!!

Palestinians, has No1 to ask for help.. even when they ask for help.. it is like screaming into the void.. 

EVERY ACTION HAS A REACTION

if Israel abuses Palestinians weekly, it is not surprising to see extremists groups like hams. 

INHUMAN ENVIRONMENT PROMOTES INHUMAN ACTIONS

This is part of Israeli government plan, taking people's rights and giving them no options, promoting hatred which leads to the formation of extremists and terrorists then they use it as excuse to kill Palestinians.
