Title: CMV: it doesn't make sense how much people focus on trying to get relationships 
Post Text: I really don't get why people focus so much on dating. I always hear people online and irl talk about relationships. And I even hear men talk so much about how trying to find a partner is so difficult and that their life sucks. They act like their life is unfulfilled and pointless, and get sad about it.

But I really don't see there being much benefits from being in a relationship, especially considering cheating, breakups, arguments, and feeling sad after the breakup seem to be a common occurrence with relationships. Most people desperately trying to be in a relationship should really stop being obsessed with it, and shouldn't spend so much time trying to find a girlfriend/boyfriend.

Simply put, I don't see much benefits of a relationship that should justify spending so much time. I think it's either because of a culture thing, or some arbitrary reason.
