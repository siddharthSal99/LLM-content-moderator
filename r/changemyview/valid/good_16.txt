Title: CMV: Applications should stop asking us for our race. 
Post Text: Whenever I fill out ANY application, (SAT, bank loan, medical insurance, whatever), they ask me for my fucking race. This shit is so stupid and weird. NO OTHER COUNTRY DOES THIS?!? Why should we be so hung up about fiscal matters like race? Racial categorization is relatively inefficient as race is kinda fake. These endeavors can lead to profiling, stigmatization, foster an unhealthy (and frankly disturbing) fixation on race, and is quite frankly irrelevant. Why does the bank need to know my race when I file for a deposit or loan? Why do they need to know ANYTHING else except for my credit scores, financial situation, etc? 

Also, the way they set up these fucking applications are set up is weird. They often look like this:

Hispanic White

Hispanic Black

Hispanic Other

If checked yes for Hispanic, choose (Cuban, Colombian, Guatemalan, Mexican, Peruvian, etc etc etc)

Asian or Pacific Islander (then makes me choose Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, Thai, etc etc etc)

Indigenous American or Native Alaskan

Black

White (including Middle Eastern)

Some forms have slightly differing formats, but this is the most common format I've seen. I'm Asian, half Chinese half Korean, and IDK if I'm supposed to choose both Korean and Chinese, other, or what. It's unclear. Also, my Middle Eastern friend brought up how it's weird that they give so many diverse options for Hispanic and Asian people, but just lump white and Middle Eastern people together and don't give more in depth answers, and that lumping in Middle Eastern with white doesn't really make sense in the first place.Lumping in Asians and Pacific Islanders together doesn't make much sense either. Also, why say "Hispanic" instead of "Latino?" What are Brazilians supposed to put lol? What about Indigenous South Americans, or Mestizo latinos? Should they choose "Hispanic other?"

This seems shockingly similar to the racial profiling and tests employed to legitimize the 1 drop rule in the segregated South. Conservatives don't like this because it makes us focus on race, which is valid. Liberals SHOULDN'T like it because it leads to profiling. It is really irrelevant and outdated and should be stopped.
