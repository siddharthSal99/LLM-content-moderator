Title: CMV: Bullet Train is criminally underrated. 
Post Text: I know Bullet train came out like a year ago but I saw it for the first time last night. It was fucking amazing. The comedy, action, cinematography, and characters were all spectacular. No action movie with such a large cast of characters has made them feel as unique and distinct from each other. The twist at the end was engaging too. The best part of this movie was that it didn't take itself too seriously. It felt fresh and unique from all the other action comedies I've watched in that it wasn't really complex. It didn't tell us much about the backgrounds of many characters and I wasn't really asking myself "uh what does Ladybug's organization actually do" because I was too engaged in the movie. FANTASTIC PERFORMACES. Brad Pitt delivered again, this time in a very funny way. Aaron Taylor Johnson, Brian Tyree Henry, Hiroyuki Sanada, and everyone else performed well again. The movie had a very unique aesthetic and I loved it. David Leitch is an amazing director, and I've thoroughly enjoyed every single one of his movies I've watched. 10/10 highly recommend, the best movie of the 2020s so far. Outclasses everything Marvel has put out in this decade, outclasses every boring ass drama, outclasses Everything Everywhere All at Once (did not deserve all those Oscars), and SURPASSES SHITTY JOY RIDE! Fuck that movie. Out of every single Asian move that came out this decade (Shang Chi, EEAO, Joy Ride, and Bullet Train), THE ONE STARRING THE WHITE GUY WAS THE BEST LMAO! (I'm Asian chill.)
