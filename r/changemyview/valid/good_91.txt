Title: CMV: Virginity is not a virtue or a value 
Post Text: I hope I don't offend anyone here, after all everyone should live their life as they see fit.

However I can't understand how virginity may still be seen as a moral value or a virtue in the modern world, it just boggles my mind. 

I think we can all agree that a healthy sex life is good for the body and the mind, (after all either sex is bad in all cases, including between wedded couples, or it's good in all cases). in modern society we have lots of people sad and depressed because they can't have sex, not the opposite.  

I don't know why it was in the first place, maybe in the past it was seen a a way to insure your wife/husband to be didn't give you some nasty STD that may even kill you. Well that clearly doesn't apply anymore, thanks to screening and cures that risk is gone.   
Or maybe it's just the religious aspect that is still important to people, but religious customs have changed in time, hardly anyone still lives religion like they did in past centuries. 

In this day and age I can't see why knowing that my partner is a virgin should tell me anything about him/her moral stand.

Edit: lots of comments on my “either all sex is good or all sex is bad” line. 
Clearly I didn’t mean that rape, incest ecc are good. 
What I meant is that if everyone (including religious people) agree that sex is good for married couples, then it must be good for non-married couple.

In other worlds if you have 2 couples, one married for 5 years and one living together for 5 years, it wouldn't make much sense to say that sex helps one couple bond and be happy together but is bad for the other
